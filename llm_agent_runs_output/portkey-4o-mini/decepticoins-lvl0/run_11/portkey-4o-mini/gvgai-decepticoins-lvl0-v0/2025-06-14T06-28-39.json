In the immediate area, there are the following elements:\n\n- To the left (5, 6): empty space (.)\n- To the right (5, 8): a floor hole (0) \n- Above (4, 7): empty space (.)\n- Below (6, 7): wall (w)\n\nThe goal is to manipulate the boxes and remove them effectively, while also avoiding hazards.\n\nIn this situation, I should prioritize moving the avatar towards the box (5, 9) to interact with it. The available action options are:\n\n- ACTION_LEFT (5, 6): Move to the empty space and will not help with the goal of removing boxes.\n- ACTION_RIGHT (5, 8): Move to the hole (0) but does not help in box removal right now as it leads away from the box.\n- ACTION_UP (4, 7): Move to the empty space (.) again, not effective for box removal.\n\nThe most logical move is to push the box at (5, 9) into (5, 10) which is a hole, thereby achieving our objective and securing a point.\n\nHence, I will use ACTION_RIGHT again in anticipation of pushing the box.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action should lead to the avatar successfully moving to (5, 8), allowing for the interaction with the box next, and will contribute towards removing boxes from the level effectively."
