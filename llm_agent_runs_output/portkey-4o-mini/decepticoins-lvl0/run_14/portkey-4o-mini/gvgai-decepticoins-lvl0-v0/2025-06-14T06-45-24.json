Specifically, there are boxes located at (5, 9) and the holes at (5, 8) and (5, 10). Additionally, there's a coin at (2, 11) and another at (3, 11).\n\nTo proceed, I should first check the possible actions. Since I am currently at (1, 4) and there are no immediate threats from the piranha (none visible in the vicinity), I can either move left to (1, 3) or right to (1, 5), or focus on box manipulation.\n\nGiven the available actions and the goal of moving boxes to holes, my next step should be to move towards the box at (5, 9). Moving to (1, 5) would keep me clear of walls and provide more options for subsequent moves.\n\nI will take the action to move right to (1, 5):\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nThis action places me in a position where I can potentially move towards manipulating the boxes or collecting coins on following turns.

The surrounding entities in the same row are a wall (w) on the right (column 12) and coins (represented by '#') at row 3, column 1 and row 4, column 1 above it. Additionally, there are 'boxes' (represented by '@') located at row 5, column 9.\n\nThe strategy suggests avoiding the piranha (not currently visible in the state provided) while manipulating boxes and collecting coins. Since no immediate movement can be made due to walls obstructing right, let's analyze the rules and potential actions.\n\nSince the avatar is currently positioned at row 5, column 11, I will attempt to move **down** to row 6, column 11, which is a wall. This means no movement will occur. \n\nThus, I will attempt to take action left. Since there is no wall to the left at (5,10):\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nI expect this action to align with the strategy as there is potential for interaction with the box located in (5,9) on my next turn."

The 'avatar' can push the 'box' at (5, 9) into the hole at (5, 8) to eliminate it and score points.\n2. This movement does not put the 'avatar' in danger from the 'piranha', as there are no immediate threats nearby.\n\nThus, the best action is to move the 'avatar' left to push the box into the hole.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action should advance the game state by removing one box and positioning the avatar closer to the goal of collecting points and eliminating all boxes."
