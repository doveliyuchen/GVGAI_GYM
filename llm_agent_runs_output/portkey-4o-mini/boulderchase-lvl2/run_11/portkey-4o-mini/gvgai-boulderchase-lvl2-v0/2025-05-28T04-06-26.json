Analyzing the surrounding area, there are walls (represented by 'c') directly to the left (4, 21), right (4, 23), above (3, 22), and below (5, 22), making all immediate movement directions impossible without first navigating other tiles.\n\nWe have a boulder ('@') at (4, 23) and various collectibles nearby on the tile layout. However, since the avatar is currently blocked from immediate movement, we must engage strategically.\n\n### Action Decision:\n1. **Check for available attacks** - There are no enemies in immediate proximity (checked tiles around: (3,22), (5,22), (4,21), (4,23) are all walls or boulders, and beyond them, we would need to navigate to access items).\n2. **Plan an action** - Since there are no open spaces to move towards due to walls, I will check if there's any possibility to interact with the immediate surroundings using the sword on a nearby boulder to initiate movement options.\n\nIn this context, the most logical action will be to attempt to use a boulder that could help open paths for collecting diamonds.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action seeks to interact with the boulder, expecting it might allow me to clear a path or reposition it strategically for later use."

    "content": "Given the current game state, my avatar is positioned at (4, 22). The goal is to navigate through the map, collect diamonds (up to 9), and avoid losing all health. Here's a brief analysis of the immediate surroundings:\n\n- **(4, 22)**: My avatar's current position is on a dirt sprite ('*'), which allows movement but is surrounded by a boulder ('@') on the right (4, 23) and a crab ('c') on the left (4, 21).\n- My immediate options appear limited: moving left (to 4, 21) would place me next to a crab, while moving right (to 4, 23) would lead to a boulder.\n- There are diamonds located nearby at (2, 2), (2, 11), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 6), (4, 24), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), etc., that I can aim to collect, but I cannot exceed 9.\n\nIn considering my strategy, I must first navigate away from immediate threats and towards potential diamond pickups. Rotating right to face the boulder does not change my position, but I need to act differently from my last action.\n\nSince the left is blocked by a crab, a right move may not be beneficial since it would hit a boulder. Instead, I will try to move down (action 4) to see if it will open a passage without encountering enemies immediately.\n\nExecuting:\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action intends to maneuver downward, potentially revealing more opportunities while avoiding immediate threats. I'm expecting to navigate away from the crab and toward a clearer space."

Collect the diamond at (row=6, col=22), which is directly below your current position.\n2. Be cautious of the surrounding crabs that can affect your health.\n3. Ensure that collecting the diamond does not exceed the limit of 9 diamonds overall.\n\n### Action Decision:\nGiven that collecting the diamond directly below would increase your score without immediately compromising your health (since there are no immediate enemies in this direction), the most strategic action would be to move down to collect it.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action is expected to effectively increase your score while maintaining a careful strategy to avoid enemy engagements."
