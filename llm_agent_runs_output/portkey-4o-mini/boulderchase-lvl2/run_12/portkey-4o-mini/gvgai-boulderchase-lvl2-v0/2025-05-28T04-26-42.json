However, neither direction leads to immediate collection objectives.\n- The left `(row=2, col=19)` or right `(row=2, col=21)` movements will similarly lead to background spaces.\n\n### Best Action\n- While we don't find immediate diamonds nearby, moving in one of the directions will allow further navigation to gather diamonds later.\n- I suggest we take the action to **move **RIGHT** to `(row=2, col=21)`**.
