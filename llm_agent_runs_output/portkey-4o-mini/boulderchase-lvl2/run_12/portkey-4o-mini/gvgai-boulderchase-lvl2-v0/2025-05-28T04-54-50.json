The layout suggests that there are diamonds (`&`), enemies (represented by `c`, `b`, `d`, etc.), and various obstacles that I must navigate around.\n\nFirst, I notice there are several diamonds at my current row (5), specifically at positions (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 8), and (5, 24). However, I also need to be mindful of my surroundings, especially the enemy sprites as I collect resources.\n\nI will perform an action to maximize my movement towards the nearby diamonds while keeping score and avoiding enemies. Given my position, I will move left to (5, 21) since it is not occupied by an enemy and will allow interaction with any potential items in that direction.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving left will help me advance towards collecting the necessary diamonds while keeping an eye on the potential dangers nearby."

In the immediate vicinity:\n- Up (row 4, col 22): empty space (.)\n- Down (row 6, col 22): empty space (*)\n- Left (row 5, col 21): empty space (*)\n- Right (row 5, col 23): (sword) (@)\n\nI have several options, but I need to ensure that I make progress towards collecting diamonds while being cautious of potential enemies.\n\nSince the cell to the right contains a sword, which could help in combating enemies, I will move to the right. This also allows me to potentially prepare for future encounters while keeping resources in mind.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nI expect this action will position me to either plan for future moves or directly interact with the sword, aiding my potential in resource management and combat strategies.

(empty space).\n- Below (6, 22) is 'c' (crab).\n  \nThe map has numerous crabs and other enemies nearby, which implies the need for cautious movement. Collecting resources (diamonds represented as '&') is vital for reaching the exit door.\n\n### Strategic Considerations\n- The avatar should avoid moving to (6, 22) where the crab is, as it poses a danger.\n- Moving up to (4, 22) may allow for more strategic maneuvers since it's an empty tile, and the space above could offer potential movements towards collecting diamonds located in the upper rows.\n\n### Decision\nTo gain a better position and plan the next move effectively, I will move **up** to (4, 22).\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nThis move will help avoid enemies directly, and I expect to reevaluate potential diamond pickups in the next turn."
