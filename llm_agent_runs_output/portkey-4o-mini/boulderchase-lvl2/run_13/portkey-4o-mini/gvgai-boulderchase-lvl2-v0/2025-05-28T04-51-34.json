The nearest diamonds are located nearby, but there's a wall of crabs to navigate:\n\n1. **Movement Options:**\n   - Up (3, 20) -> (2, 20) (c)\n   - Down (3, 20) -> (4, 20) (c)\n   - Left (3, 20) -> (3, 19) (a space)\n   - Right (3, 20) -> (3, 21) (a space)\n\nAt this state, moving down or up towards crabs would not collect diamonds and might put the avatar in danger.
