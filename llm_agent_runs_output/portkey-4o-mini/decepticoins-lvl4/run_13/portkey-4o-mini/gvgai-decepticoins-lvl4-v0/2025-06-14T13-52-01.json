Since the current position allows for left or right movement, and there are no immediate hazards around, moving left to (10, 5) could be beneficial. It may open up new paths or further clear space for box interactions without immediate threat from enemies.\n\n### Action Decision:\nI will choose to move left to explore further and see what options open up. \n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis left move should maintain a strategic position while avoiding immediate hazards. I expect to open new pathways or gather items, advancing toward the goal of eliminating boxes."
