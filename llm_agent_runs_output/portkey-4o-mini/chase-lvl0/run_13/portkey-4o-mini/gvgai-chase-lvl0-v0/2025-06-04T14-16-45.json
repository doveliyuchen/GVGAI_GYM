The nearest scared sprite seems to be at (6, 22).\n\nGiven the layout, the most strategic movement would be to move **upwards to (8, 8)** or **to the left to (9, 7)** to properly position your goat towards the scared sprites. \n\nLet\u2019s try a directional action that could lead to strategizing our position effectively:\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \nThis action would be to move **downwards**. The expectation is that upon reviewing the movement possibility, you should be able to analyze further actions towards the nearest scared sprite without encountering any immediate threats."

I need to avoid the angry sprite and ensure my position does not become compromised.\n\n### Movement Possibilities\nThe goat is currently located at (8, 19). From this position, I can consider the following possible actions:\n\n1. **Left (ACTION_LEFT)** to (8, 18): This would put me next to a wall; hence, this is not a good move.\n2. **Right (ACTION_RIGHT)** to (8, 20): Still a free space, but no additional benefits are offered.\n3. **Down (ACTION_DOWN)** to (9, 19): This moves me further down into a clear space.\n4. **Up (ACTION_UP)** to (7, 19): Again, this is clear space but moves me away from interacting with the scared sprites.\n\n### Choosing an Action\nThe most strategic action appears to be moving **down (ACTION_DOWN)** to (9, 19).

The immediate threat is ensuring the goat does not come into contact with any angry sprites, but currently, there are no visible angry sprites in proximity to the goat.\n2.

However, up and left would lead to a wall or unproductive space, while moving to the right could potentially allow interaction with another dot.\n- Considering the need to engage with the scared sprites nearby, the best potential move is to move down to (2, 5), as it is a valid move space and sets up paths toward the nearby scared sprites.\n\n### Decision:\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving down keeps the goat out of wall collision and allows future moves toward the scared sprites.
