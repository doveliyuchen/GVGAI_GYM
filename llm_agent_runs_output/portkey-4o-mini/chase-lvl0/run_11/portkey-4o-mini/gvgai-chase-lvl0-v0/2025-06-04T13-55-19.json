Moving up (3, 14) keeps the avatar nearer to the sprites at (3, 3) and (3, 8).\n\nI will choose to move up:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action promotes progression towards gathering scared sprites while maintaining a safe distance from any threats.

The space to the **right** `(9, 8)` also remains clear and can lead to further movement towards open areas for the next turn.\n\nTaking into consideration the directions:\n- **LEFT** `(9, 6)` - might potentially lead to less movement options next turn.\n- **RIGHT** `(9, 8)` - embraces open space leading to future potential routes faster.\n\n### Conclusion\nI will choose to move **RIGHT** to `(9, 8)`, as it keeps my options open for future moves.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action moves the avatar into an open space that may allow for further movement without immediate obstacles."

My immediate objective is to avoid the angry sprites and manipulate the scared ones. I can safely approach the scared sprites that are relatively nearby.\n2. The carcass can be transformed into an angry sprite if left unaddressed, so acting on the scared sprites takes precedence.\n\nGiven that my last action did not move the avatar (as the avatar is still at (7, 4)), I will need to make a meaningful movement towards a target, such as a scared sprite in a safer location.\n\n### Available Action:\nMoving **UP** toward (6, 4) is an option as it opens proximity to the scared sprite at (6, 22).\n\nLet\u2019s take the **UP** action to assess subsequent reactions and sprite movements.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nBy moving UP, I aim to reposition for the next turn toward either interacting with the scared sprite or creating a strategy for transformation, thus aligning with my goal of increasing the number of scared sprites."

There are scared sprites ('@') located in the map at various positions, specifically notable in row 1 (columns 10, 11, and 20), row 2 (column 1), and row 3 (column 22), among others.\n\nThe primary objective is to transform scared sprites into carcasses ('$') while avoiding angry sprites. As per the previous actions, I should check if my position has changed after a directional action. Since there are no additional parameters provided indicating movement since the last state, I will focus on the available moves.\n\nSince my current position is not adjacent to any scared sprites and there's no immediate danger from angry sprites in the vicinity, I should evaluate the surrounding areas to find the best next action. The goal is to maneuver toward the scared sprites located on row 1, columns 10, 11, and 20 while avoiding walls.\n\nNow, let\u2019s consider the logical next move:\n- **Row 6**, **Column 4** is where I currently am. \n- I can't go directly left (to column 3) due to walls.\n- I cannot go up (to row 5, same col).\n- Down (to row 7, col 4) seems like an open area with potential paths.\n- Right (to row 6, col 5) is blocked by a wall.\n\nBased on the strategic planning, moving down will allow me to navigate toward scared sprites without risking immediate collisions.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action moves the avatar down one step, providing an opportunity to explore further toward the area where scared sprites are located while avoiding confrontation with walls and enemies."

The closest scared sprite is at (row 1, col 10), but there are several other scared sprites present on the map. \n\nUsing the strategy of avoiding combat with angry sprites and focusing on transforming scared sprites, the best course of action right now would be to move either up or down. Going up (to row 6, col 4) will get you closer to the area with more scared sprites while keeping you away from the walls where angry sprites might appear.\n\nTherefore, I will perform the action to move up.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nThis action aligns with the strategy to evade confrontation with angry sprites and focus on gathering scared sprites."

Although there is no immediate interaction available, moving down to (row=7, col=4) may offer a strategic benefit by keeping options open.\n\nSince I've not moved from the last position (row=6, col=4), I need to take a valid moving action to adjust my position to better position towards a win condition.\n\nI will choose to move down to (row=7, col=4) where it would keep my movement options open:\n\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\n\nThis action allows me to reposition myself while avoiding walls and potential threats, aligning with my strategy of movement optimization. I expect to see an empty space at the new location (row=7, col=4), maintaining safety for the next turn."
