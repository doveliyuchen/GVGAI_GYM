The best course of action is to move either left or right to avoid encountering 'angry' sprites.\n- Moving down will place the avatar adjacent to another 'angry' sprite (3, 8), so it's decision time between moving up (to take cover in the map and prevent any 'angry' sprite encounters).\n\nGiven these considerations, the best action according to the suggested overall strategy is to **move UP (row=2, col=14)** away from the proximity of 'angry' sprites.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action should reposition the avatar safely while maintaining an opportunity to target the nearby 'scared' sprites afterwards.
