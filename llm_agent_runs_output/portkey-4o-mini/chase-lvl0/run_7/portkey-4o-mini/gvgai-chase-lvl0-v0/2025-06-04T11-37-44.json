Since I can only move through spaces (.) and need to increase proximity to any scared sprites ('@'), the immediate paths are either up or down.\n2.

The goal is to move my avatar towards the \"scared\" sprites to eliminate them.\n2. I need to navigate safely, staying away from any potential encounters with angry sprites.\n3. Since none of the current immediate actions can directly manipulate the scared sprites and the avatar hasn\u2019t changed position, I should first rotate and attempt to move.\n\n**Deciding Move:**\nGiven the walls around me, the best action to take now would be to move upward, which could allow for future interactions with scared sprites in subsequent turns.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```  \nThis action takes my avatar one step up towards a potentially more advantageous position for future sprite interactions.

The closest scared sprite is located at `(1, 4)`. However, you cannot move vertically into a wall row (row 0) or left into walls (row 1 columns 0-1). So, you can consider moving horizontally toward an open path.\n\nYou can move up to `(6, 4)`, which is a valid open position. The next immediate action should therefore be:\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n\nThis action should keep you local to the other sprites while allowing for potential opportunities to engage with the scared sprites shortly after moving in parallel paths. By moving upward, you will be able to examine your next potential actions towards taking out scared sprites without being obstructed by walls or getting cornered."
