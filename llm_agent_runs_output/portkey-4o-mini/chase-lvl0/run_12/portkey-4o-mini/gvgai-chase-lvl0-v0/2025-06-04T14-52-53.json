Moving left to (3, 13) or down to (4, 14) can allow for further interaction with scared sprites. However, I must verify if the sprite position has changed before repeating any previous actions.\n\nSince the avatar's last action was potentially moving or attempting to move, and currently, no movement occurred, I can proceed to take a deliberate action to maximize movement towards other scared sprites while keeping an eye on possible interactions.\n\n### Proposed Action:\nI will move left (to (3, 13)), which will potentially position the avatar better in the next moves to interact with the scared sprites (particularly those at (3, 3) and (3, 7) where I could attempt transformations). \n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action will navigate the avatar left toward a better strategic position to interact with more sprites in the upcoming turns."

However, in this case, there are walls that may block movement depending on the direction.\n4. **Potential Moves** follow the strategy noted earlier. Since my current position has no immediate threats and aims to secure more scared sprites, I would want to move toward them strategically to transform or utilize them effectively.\n\n### Current State Analysis:\n- Moving Left (to (8, 8)) results in open space.\n- Moving Right (to (8, 10)) also limits positions, but those spaces are empty.\n- Moving Up (to (7, 9)) leads to an empty space.\n- Moving Down (to (9, 9)) stays in open space.\n\nHowever, since my current position (8, 9) doesn\u2019t change after the last analyzed situation and no approach to new sprites is imminent, I will select a direction towards an open space while planning for future engagement with the scared sprites.\n\n### Action Decision:\nI will opt to move **Left** to (8, 8).\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left seems reasonable to explore the environment and position myself more favorably for future actions, especially towards possibly interacting with scared sprites."

(open space)\n\nAll adjacent cells are open spaces, allowing movement in any of the four directions (up, down, left, right).\n\n### Objective:\nThe objective of the game is to manage interactions with scared sprites ('@') and avoid the angry sprites while maximizing the score. Currently, there are no immediate threats from angry sprites visible from the avatar's position, and there are several scared sprites nearby that can potentially be interacted with.\n\n### Movement Strategy:\nSince there are open spaces available for moving, I will proceed to move the avatar to the left to see if there are additional interactions available from that position, especially since moving left (to `(8, 4)`) places the avatar next to a scared sprite (`'@'` at `(4, 4)`).\n\n### Decision:\nI'll execute the left action to maximize opportunities for interaction without introducing a risk at this moment.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left will allow an interaction with the scared sprite next to it and also create further strategic options for managing sprites in the next moves."

There are several 'scared' sprites (@) positioned in various places throughout the grid, and walls (#) are present that will affect movement.\n\n### Observations:\n1. The avatar is on the lower row of the grid (row 9) and is surrounded by walls and empty spaces.\n2. There is a potential path to the 'scared' sprites located at (1, 4), (1, 11), and (1, 20) which are above the avatar's position.\n\n### Strategy Application:\nTo proceed effectively, the avatar should move toward one of the 'scared' sprites. However, moving left (to (9, 5)), down (to (10, 6)), or right (to (9, 7)) won't encounter any 'scared' sprites. Moving up toward (8, 6) could potentially lead the avatar to move across empty spaces to navigate towards the higher rows where the 'scared' sprites are located.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nSince the goal is to interact with the 'scared' sprites, moving up seems to be the most strategic option to help the avatar navigate closer toward these sprites in subsequent turns.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nMoving up to (8, 6), I expect to navigate effectively toward the upper areas to encounter 'scared' sprites in later turns."

The strategy suggests that I should carefully manage movements and avoid getting trapped by angry sprites while also ensuring to interact positively with scared sprites.\n\nAnalyzing the current situation, I see that there is open space around the avatar at (8, 10). There are no immediate threats since there are no angry sprites in proximity.\n\nSince I'm looking to make meaningful progress, I will move down from (8, 10) to (9, 10). This action doesn't put me in danger and allows me to explore further while considering future movements towards any scared sprites.\n\nThus, I will proceed with:\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to keep my avatar safe while exploring the environment beyond the current position."
