Currently, from the layout, it appears that there are no immediate threats (angry sprites) in the vicinity of the avatar, which presents a good opportunity for movement.\n\n### Proposed Strategy\n1. The closest scared sprite to the avatar is at (1, 4). However, it is considerably far from the avatar and would require navigating around walls.\n2. There is a scared sprite at (6, 22) which is comparatively closer but still has walls that need to be navigated.\n3. An effective first move would be to reposition the avatar toward the nearest accessible area of scared sprites while avoiding any potential traps.\n\nConsidering this, to further assess the situation, the action of moving **up** (to (7, 8)) would keep options open toward continuing to evaluate the surrounding area of scared sprites in the next turns.\n\nGiven the strategy and my current position, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action moves the avatar up one position.
