The avatar can move with options available: LEFT (to `(5,2)`), RIGHT (to `(5,4)`), UP (to `(4,3)`), or DOWN (to `(6,3)`).\n2. Moving up into `(4, 3)`, navigating away from the lower rows where more thugs are present, could be a better choice to avoid confrontation while exploring the map.\n\nGiven the strategic emphasis on avoiding confrontations with thugs, it would be sensible to avoid moving towards `left` or `down`, which may lead into thugs or dead ends.\n\nThus, I will decide to move **UP** to position `(4, 3)` to explore further and gather resources while staying away from immediate threats.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action aims to re-position strategically to evade thugs while scanning for resources nearby.

Since we want to strategize towards collecting keys, avoiding confrontations, and possibly spawning sprites, moving right may be less predictable since the floor (6,2) connects towards more open space.\n\nThus, I'll move **Right** to (6,2).\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving to the right should position me better for future moves while avoiding any enemy interactions.
