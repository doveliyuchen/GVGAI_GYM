But first, since the avatar's current position is surrounded by walls to the left (row=3, col=6) and behind (down - row=4, col=7), the optimal action is to move towards the door.\n\nSince the last action did not change the position, I will try moving **right** towards the jail door (`&`) at (row=3, col=13).\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action will guide the avatar towards a potential resource point (the jail door), and if I have a key, I can unlock it in the next turn."
