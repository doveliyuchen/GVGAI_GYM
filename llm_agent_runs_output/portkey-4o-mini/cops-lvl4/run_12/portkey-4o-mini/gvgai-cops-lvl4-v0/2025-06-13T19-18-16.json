We can move **RIGHT** (to the position (4, 5)), but that is a wall ('b') and will not lead us anywhere.\n2. We can move **LEFT** (to (4, 3)), which is empty, allowing more possible movement later.\n3. We can move **UP** (to (3, 4)), which is also empty and allows more options.\n4.

The cell to the left (6, 6) is free, which may lead to more exploration opportunities, and there are no immediate threats from enemies.\n\n### Next Action\nBased on the position and environment assessment, the avatar can safely move left into (6, 6).\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left into an open cell allows for exploration without facing threats from enemies, aligning with the strategy of safe navigation."

    "content": "In the current state, the avatar 'a' is located at (row=6, col=7). The surrounding environment consists of walls ('b'), a jail ('%'), and a variety of sprites, including thugs ('*'), a boss ('@'), and jails that are unlocked by jail doors ('&'). \n\n### Observations:\n1. The avatar must avoid the thugs and can interact with the jail doors to potentially access more resources.\n2. The boss appears on (row=11, col=5) and (row=12, col=5), which means it requires careful navigation to reach.\n3. The nearest thug is located at (row=13, col=1) and (row=14, col=1) directly beneath where the player is located.\n\n### Current Strategy:\nGiven the overall strategy, it\u2019s important to avoid immediate danger from the nearby thugs while also working towards defeating the boss and collecting resources.\n\n### Next Action:\nThe avatar should first avoid moving directly down (where the thugs are), so the best course of action would be to move up towards the jail where it might be able to collect additional resources or get to safety.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nBy moving up, I expect to avoid the immediate threat of thugs and possibly open up new paths or opportunities in the game."
