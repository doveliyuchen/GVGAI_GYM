There is also a cocoon at (8, 26).\n\n### Analysis\nThe primary objective is to eliminate all butterflies while keeping the cocoon intact until we've collected enough. Currently, I should focus on collecting butterflies around my avatar while being mindful of the cocoon's location, as destroying it will lead to losing the game regardless of the butterflies collected.\n\n### Move Plan\nGiven my current position (9, 5), the immediate surrounding tiles (up, down, left, right) are:\n- Up (8, 5): Empty\n- Down (10, 5): Wall\n- Left (9, 4): Empty\n- Right (9, 6): Empty\n\nThe right (col=6) and left (col=4) positions are clear; however, there are no butterflies directly adjacent to me. I need to navigate towards the nearest butterfly, which are in rows 1 and 2. The most accessible option to move towards a cluster of butterflies would be to go left or up and then navigate to the row with butterflies.\n\nSince there's an empty tile to the left (9, 4), I will move there to start heading towards the cluster of butterflies.\n\n### Execution\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action moves my avatar left to (9, 4). I expect to continue advancing towards butterflies without entering a dead end."

The cocoon is located at (row 8, col 26). \n\n### Immediate Goals\n1. Eliminate butterflies while ensuring the cocoon is not destroyed prematurely (to avoid losing the game).\n2. The strategy is to continue to collect butterflies while navigating away from the cocoon until the maximum number of butterflies have been taken down.\n\n### Current Analysis\nThere are two butterflies straight above and two to the left of the avatar that can be collected without interacting with walls or the cocoon. \n\nGiven the current position, we can move up to (row 7, col 17), but there's no immediate benefit in terms of butterflies there. The most beneficial moves would be to collect the nearby butterflies while maintaining distance from the cocoon.\n\n### Possible Actions\n1. **Left**: Moving left helps to get closer to the butterflies located at (row 8, col 4).\n2. **Right** or **Down**: Would either lead towards walls or butterfly encounters, which might not be efficient at this stage.\n\nSince moving left can allow me to engage with more butterflies while managing the cocoon, let's take that action.\n\n### Decision\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action will move the avatar left, allowing it to get closer to a butterfly while continuing to avoid interactions that would lead towards the cocoon. I expect to see the avatar positioned at (row 8, col 16) after this action, ready to collect butterflies on the next turn."
