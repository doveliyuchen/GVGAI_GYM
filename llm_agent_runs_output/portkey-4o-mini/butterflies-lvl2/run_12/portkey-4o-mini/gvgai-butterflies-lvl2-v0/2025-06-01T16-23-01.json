Collecting the butterflies is essential for achieving a win condition, but I need to do so while avoiding any interactions that may lead to losing points.\n3. The area right around the avatar is mostly empty, with movement possible to the left (col 9) or to the right (col 11), along with other potential movements up or down as needed in the following moves after rotation.\n\nAmong my immediate options for action, moving left might seem an initial move, but does not lead to immediate butterfly collection. The available interactions must aim for collecting butterflies to work toward the win condition.\n\nGiven that this is the first action taken, I will make a calculated move toward the closest butterfly:\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action moves the avatar to the right (row 8, col 11) and should not lead to an immediate interaction with a butterfly; however, it places the avatar closer to collecting butterflies in subsequent moves. I expect to see further movement options revealed in the next state to facilitate strategy toward the ultimate goal of collecting all butterflies."
