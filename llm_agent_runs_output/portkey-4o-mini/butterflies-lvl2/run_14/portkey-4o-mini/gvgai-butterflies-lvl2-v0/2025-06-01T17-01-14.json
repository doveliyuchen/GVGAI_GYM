There are significant obstacles (walls) surrounding the avatar. The closest butterflies are at (5, 14) and (5, 7), both too far for immediate interaction this turn. \n\n### Immediate Strategic Considerations:\n- **Objective Importance**: I need to eliminate all butterflies before any cocoons are destroyed.\n- **Avoidance**: I need to stay out of reach of butterflies for now while navigating towards a strategic position.\n- **Action Selection**: The first step is to move to open areas where I can plan further actions (like luring butterflies away from danger zones).\n\nCurrently, my avatar cannot engage any butterflies without risking contact. Moreover, I should consider maneuvering to an area with better control over current game elements. The open space to my left (5, 22 and below) presents a reasonable option.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nI will move **LEFT** to (5, 22), where I can assess future moves more safely.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left positions me away from immediate danger while maintaining an awareness of the butterflies, aligning with the strategy of careful navigation and score management."

The current layout means you'll potentially run into a butterfly if you move down.\n- There are walls (`$`) surrounding your avatar, limiting movement options, especially moving left or right.\n- The closest cocoon is at (5, 1) and (5, 2), and there are more cocoons below (7, 4) and (8, 3).\n\n### Action Decision\nSince moving down would risk your avatar colliding with a butterfly, the available actions are left or right. However, both directions are blocked by walls. \n\nGiven that no action will allow for an immediate move, the best course of action is to attempt to focus on navigation while avoiding contact with obstacles.\n\n### Expected Strategy Alignment\nThe first action will involve verifying whether the avatar can rotate or needs to perform a different action. Subsequently, if you remain immobile, exploring potential alternate moves (if applicable) will be necessary later.\n\n``` Action:0 ```\nWhile this does not change the state, I will assess the layout for a better understanding of movement options in future turns. My expectation aligns with gathering sufficient information to navigate effectively."

Since moving up or down is obstructed by either walls or other sprites, it's strategic to first move right where there are fewer obstructions.\n\nExecuting the action to move right:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action is expected to provide better positioning to strategize against the butterflies without hitting a wall, enabling potential next moves or interactions with nearby butterflies."

The immediate surroundings include:\n\n- At (row 8, col 0): Wall ($)\n- At (row 8, col 2): Empty (.)\n- At (row 8, col 3): Empty (.)\n- At (row 8, col 4): Empty (.)\n- At (row 8, col 5): Butterfly (@)\n\nThe butterflies nearby pose a threat as they can kill the avatar, and considering there's a butterfly at the immediate right position (row 8, col 5), moving right could be a bad idea unless we have a safe way to deal with it.\n\nGiven the goal is to eliminate all butterflies while avoiding losing conditions around cocoons (and it appears we have several nearby), I need to ensure that I do not put myself in a position where I could get killed.\n\nSince your last action's result indicates no movement, I'll check available options to navigate safely. \n\nThe best course of action is to move left to (row 8, col 0) to avoid the butterfly, but that isn\u2019t feasible due to the wall. Instead, I should consider moving down to (row 9, col 1), which is safe since there are only walls and empty spaces there, allowing me to reassess my strategies without immediate threats.\n\nTherefore, my chosen action is:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action is expected to keep the avatar safe while allowing observation of the surrounding layout to plan the next moves effectively."

    "content": "Based on the current state of the game, the avatar (represented as 'a') is positioned at (9, 1). There are multiple butterflies ('@') in the vicinity, especially in rows above the avatar\u2019s position, and there is a cocoon ('#') located at (9, 25). The walls ('$') create a somewhat restricted movement area.\n\nAccording to the strategy provided:\n\n1. I should avoid the butterflies, as they can kill the avatar.\n2. I need to interact with butterflies carefully, ideally killing them before considering destroying any cocoons.\n3. Since the avatar has not moved in the last state, I will need to pick a new action that ensures movement and adheres to strategic avoidance of contact with butterflies.\n\nConsidering the proximity of the walls and the action choices available, moving up in direction (4) would be a beneficial first step to navigate through the space and away from immediate butterfly threats, especially since there's a wall directly to the left and below.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action is intended to move the avatar up, allowing it to navigate away from the butterflies and potentially open up further strategic options for later turns. I hope this aligns with the strategy of avoiding danger while positioning well for future moves."

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, your avatar is at position (8, 1) and surrounded by several butterflies and walls which creates a challenging situation for maneuvering.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Butterflies**: There are multiple butterflies at positions (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 13), (8, 14), (8, 22), (8, 23), (8, 24), (8, 25) which are potential threats.\n2. **Cocoons**: There is a cocoon at (9, 25) which can be destroyed to eliminate a butterfly if needed.\n3. **Walls**: The walls at (0, c), (7, c) where c ranges from 0 to 27, will limit your movement options.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nBased on the current environment, it is crucial to **avoid contact with butterflies** while also **strategically navigating** toward the cocoon or making space to eliminate some butterflies. The avatar is currently in a position that could potentially be surrounded by butterflies soon.\n\n### Possible Movements:\n1. **Moving Right (to (8, 2))**: This takes you to an empty spot, making some space.\n2. **Moving Left**: Not possible, as it's already at the leftmost column occupied by a wall.\n3. **Moving Up**: Not possible because of walls directly above.\n4. **Moving Down (to (9, 1))**: Moving down is also limited as you will still face walls.\n\nSince the best move is to create an escape route, I suggest moving **right** to (8, 2).\n\n``` \nAction:2 \n```\n\nThis should allow you to reposition your avatar to a safer location and analyze further options while adhering to the objective of managing butterflies appropriately."
