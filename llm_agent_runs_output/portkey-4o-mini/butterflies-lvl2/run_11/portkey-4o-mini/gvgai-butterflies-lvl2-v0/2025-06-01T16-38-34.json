Our main priorities are:\n\n1. **Eliminate butterflies** to progress towards our win condition.\n2. **Avoid allowing the cocoon to remain** as it could lead to a loss.\n\nTo proceed, we need a strategic action that either positions us to attack a butterfly or to take steps towards the cocoon while avoiding walls.\n\nSince the avatar is at position (8, 6), the immediate adjacent spaces around the avatar are:\n- (8, 5): empty (.)\n- (8, 7): empty (.)\n- (7, 6): empty (.)\n- (9, 6): empty (.)\n\nThere are no walls directly adjacent. Therefore, moving up to (7, 6) seems a plausible option:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action allows the avatar to move up and prepares for potential next interactions with a nearby butterfly or helps maneuver towards cocoon interactions without hitting barriers. I expect to be able to assess the next move toward either butterflies or the cocoon after this action."

Since the avatar is currently at (8, 6) and there are no immediate butterflies to the left, right, up, or down, we need to strategize on movement.\n2. The nearest butterfly is at (3, 13) which requires navigating through some empty spaces.\n\n### Strategic Movement\nTo advance towards a butterfly:\n- I will move up (ACTION_UP) towards row 7 first, where there are no obstructions and provide a clearer path to the butterflies on row 4, eventually leading to the elimination of the butterflies.\n\n### Executing the Action\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action moves the avatar up to (7, 6), providing a strategic position to then navigate toward killing butterflies on row 4 in subsequent turns."
