However, the goal is to also retain cocoons from being lost. Therefore, we should be cautious to avoid any action that may result in losing a cocoon inadvertently.\n\n### Decision:\n1. **Action Options**:\n   - **UP**: Moves to `(2, 11)` where it's empty, potentially positioning near multiple butterflies in the next moves.\n   - **LEFT**: Moves to `(3, 10)` where it will not encounter anything useful.\n   - **RIGHT or DOWN**: Moves to `(3, 12)` or `(4, 11)` where it's also empty.\n\nGiven the borders the game provides and the avoidance of unnecessary movement which ultimately does not lead to engaging butterflies or saving cocoons, moving **UP** seems to be the most effective action available.\n\nThus, I'll proceed with the action selection:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving up will allow me to engage with nearby butterflies in the following turn more effectively while keeping safe cocoons intact."

Eliminate enough butterflies to reach a certain threshold while ensuring that all cocoons are not destroyed and thus maintaining balance.\n\n### Movement Consideration\n- Since your previous movement leaves you at the same position, we might have rotated but not moved yet. \n- Avoiding collisions is essential, thus any movement should ensure progress without unnecessary setbacks.\n\n### Action Decision\nFrom your current location (3, 13):\n- Attempt to move **Right** (to (3, 14)), as there is a butterfly located there.\n\n### Expected Outcome\nThis action will potentially allow you to collide with and score from the butterfly without any risk of running into a wall or losing a cocoon.\n\nTherefore, I will proceed with the following action:\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\nThis action is expected to result in collecting a butterfly while maintaining your strategic position."
