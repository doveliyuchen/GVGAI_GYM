To **avoid butterflies** impacting your score negatively, you should move away from any single butterfly or clusters of butterflies that are close.\n2. There is a cocoon directly below your current position that can be converted into a butterfly, which is crucial for your scoring.\n3. Since interacting with butterflies kills your avatar and increases score, the best strategy is to move towards the cocoon while avoiding the butterflies as much as possible.\n\nGiven that your avatar is currently positioned in row 9, col 1, you would want to move **down (ACTION_DOWN)** to row 10 because:\n- It places you in a position to manage interactions without visiting butterfly-laden spaces.\n- This keeps you out of direct reach of butterflies in your current row.\n\nI will execute the action: \n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis movement keeps away from clusters of butterflies, and I expect it allows further strategizing for transforming cocoons into butterflies."
