The objective is to reach the goal while navigating hazards such as barriers and potentially rolling barrels.\n\nHere are some potential actions based on the current environment:\n- **Move Up:** The avatar can attempt to move up to (17, 9) or (17, 10), but the nearest walls and barriers might limit movement.\n- **Move Left or Right:** Moving left to positions (18, 8) or (18, 7) has limited speed as those spaces appear clear. Moving right to (18, 11) does not seem to encounter obstacles.\n  \nSince the avatar's position has not changed since the last action, I need to decide a different action to proceed strategically. Given that there are barrels nearby, attempting to clear one might help in progressing toward the goal.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will choose to move right to broaden the pathway and prevent further hazards.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving right is expected to clear the path and maintain approach toward the goal while avoiding any immediate dangers."
