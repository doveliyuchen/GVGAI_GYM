There are barriers, represented by walls ('%'), and barrels that can roll or break, which may pose hazards during navigation.\n\n### Current Strategy Focus\n1. **Navigation**: To reach the goal, we first need to navigate through the level safely, avoiding walls and potential rolling barrels.\n2. **Use of Arrows**: The avatar has access to arrows that can interact with barrels, particularly breakable ones ('*').\n3. **Initial Movement**: Before executing any directional actions to move closer to the goal, we should stay aware of barriers nearby and plan our moves.\n\n### Analysis of Potential Moves\nGiven the current position (18, 21), the next immediate moves can be assessed:\n\n- **UP (to 17, 21)**: This moves the avatar directly toward a wall ('%'), resulting in no movement. Essentially, this will just rotate and won't help us move forward.\n- **DOWN (to 19, 21)**: This takes the avatar further down but stays within the walls.\n- **LEFT (to 18, 20)**: This direction is open, moving the avatar into an empty space.\n- **RIGHT (to 18, 22)**: This also leads to an empty space.\n- **USE**: This would potentially use an arrow, but in the current context, it might be more fruitful to explore the navigational options first.\n\nAmong these, moving left (to 18, 20) or right (to 18, 22) offers potential to navigate around the area without immediately hitting walls. Since there's more open space moving right, I will choose that action first.\n\n### Chosen Action\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action moves the avatar to the right, which should help us avoid immediate barriers and allows further exploration towards the goal.
