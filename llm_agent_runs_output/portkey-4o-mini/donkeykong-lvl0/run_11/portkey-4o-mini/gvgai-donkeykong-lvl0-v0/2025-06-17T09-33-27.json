The immediate area to the left or right of the avatar contains walls, hence the avatar may need to take an upward or downward action to progress.\n\nI'll choose to move **UP** to see if there are any opportunities to get around barriers or score more points while heading towards the goal.\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \nMoving up should provide a clearer view of the area and potential next steps towards reaching the goal."

Moving towards the arrows is a logical next step, as acquiring more arrows can facilitate clearing obstacles later on.\n3. The nearby walls and barrels could become problematic if not dealt with.\n\n### Possible Actions:\n- **PICK UP ARROWS:** Since arrows are essential for clearing obstacles, the first step would be to move and collect them.\n- **LEFT (2)** or **RIGHT (3)** would not only allow you to rotate but also move towards the arrows sequentially.\n\nGiven that the avatar's position is the same as last time, I will act to collect an arrow:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action moves down to (19, 11), meaning I can pick up the arrow on my next move while avoiding obstacles.

The avatar's position (18, 12) does not change as expressed in the game rules, meaning the planned action must be different from the last one to yield any maneuverability.\n\n### Possible Actions:\n1. **ACTION_LEFT (2)** - Move left to (18, 11) where there is no obstacle, allowing further strategies.\n2. **ACTION_RIGHT (3)** - Move right to (18, 13) where there's nothing obstructive as well.\n3. **ACTION_DOWN (4)** - Move down to (19, 12) where there is a wall; hence this action would be invalid.\n4. **ACTION_UP (5)** - Move up to (17, 12) where there is a wall; hence this action would be invalid.\n5. **ACTION_USE (1)** - This would be useful for arrows, but given that arrows are present at (18, 21) and (18, 22), might yield little benefit in this immediate move.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven these observations, moving left or right seems promising for constructive gameplay.
