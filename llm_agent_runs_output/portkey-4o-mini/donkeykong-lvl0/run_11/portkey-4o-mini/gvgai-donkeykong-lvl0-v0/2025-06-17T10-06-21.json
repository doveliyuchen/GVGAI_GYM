The avatar is currently standing in a relatively clear area, making it safer to perform actions like shooting arrows.\n\n### Current Action Validity:\n- Since the avatar has not moved and we want to take an action:\n   - **Shooting Arrows**: It would be best to use an action to shoot arrows at one of the breakable barrels that can potentially clear a path or maximize our score.\n\n### Selected Action:\nGiven the proximity to barrels, I will take the action to shoot an arrow (using action 1).\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\n\n### Feedback on the Action:\nUsing the arrow will help clear barrels and potentially open new pathways closer to the goal while maximizing my score. I expect to see at least one barrel getting destroyed, thereby providing a clearer way to navigate towards the goal."

Hence, the strategic move here is to shoot an arrow at one of the breakable barrels to generate potential openings or to collect arrows.\n\nAfter considering the layout, the best immediate action is to **move **DOWN (Action 4)** as it navigates away from wall constriction and toward more open areas on the map which may yield new potential routes or collectible items. \n\nThus the action I will take is:\n``` Action: 4 ```\n\nThis action is expected to facilitate easier navigation and lead toward better opportunities for interacting with the environment."

No barrels are directly in line horizontally, but there are breakable barrels towards the right (in the future, you may shoot arrows to destroy one).\n\n**Next Step**: Since the avatar didn't move last turn, we should first check if rotating occurs. However, since there are no obstacles directly blocking you in your current perception, the best course of action seems to be moving down (since there's a breakable barrel directly below, this action also opens up potential interactions).\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\n\nThis should set up the avatar for either further movement toward breaking a barrel or implementing another action in the next turn while progressing toward the goal."

The primary objective is to reach the goal, which is located at (row 1, col 26).\n\n### Analyzing the Current Situation:\n1. **Avatar Position**: (18, 21)\n2. **Nearest Features**: \n   - The nearest arrows are located at (18, 28) and (18, 29).\n   - There are two tough barrels located at (18, 30) and (18, 31).\n   - The goal is at (1, 26).\n\n### Actions Available:\n- Right (to (18, 22) ) - there is open space.\n- Up (to (17, 21)) - there is a wall, blocked.\n- Left (to (18, 20)) - there is open space.\n- Down (to (19, 21)) - there is a wall, blocked.\n- Use (ACTION_USE) - might be useful if an interaction is applicable, such as shooting an arrow or interacting with something in the vicinity.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven that I am currently positioned next to arrows and have a clear path to the right, moving right appears to be a strategic choice to maximize loot collection and avoid tough barrels. \n\nThe move to the right (to (18, 22)) will also allow me to explore more of the environment for potential interactions.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\n\nMoving right, allows access to possible arrows while keeping an eye on tough barrels. My expectation is to be able to gather resources while continuing towards the goal."
