Surrounding the avatar are various elements including walls ('b'), jail ('%'), jail doors ('&'), and there are two boss sprites ('@') located to the south (rows 13 and 14) of the map.\n\n### State Analysis:\n1. The avatar is in a relatively safe position surrounded by floors (represented by '.') and to the south, there are four bosses.\n2. The immediate moves available for the avatar are:\n   - Up: (row=5, col=3)\n   - Down: (row=7, col=3)\n   - Left: (row=6, col=2)\n   - Right: (row=6, col=4)\n\nAmong these options:\n- Moving up (to (5, 3)) would keep the avatar on the floor.\n- Moving down (to (7, 3)) again will keep it on the floor but does not advance toward the boss sprites.\n- Moving left (to (6, 2)) keeps it on the floor but does not contribute toward defeating any bosses.\n- Moving right (to (6, 4)) is also to the floor, and while it doesn\u2019t immediately change position either, it is important to check if it rotates first and subsequently could allow further movement.\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nSince the initial position of the avatar does not change from any previous move and to successfully engage toward the next meaningful action, I will attempt to move **right** to get into a position that might allow further strategies toward the bosses.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis right action aligns with navigating towards the next potential steps toward addressing the bosses, keeping the avatar moving strategically within the safe zones. Expectation is to either position better for resource collection or confrontation soon."

There are also red thugs ('*') at (11, 10) and (12, 10) nearby.\n\n### Strategy Assessment\nFollowing the strategy:\n- We need to engage with the thugs to collect resources, and at the same time, we need to be careful about managing our time.\n- It's imperative to collect keys and interact with various resources.\n\n### Current Options\nGiven your avatar is stationary, let's decide on the next action:\n- Moving up (to (5, 9)) or down (to (7, 9)) doesn't yield compelling immediate advantages as they are all open floor tiles.\n- Moving left (to (6, 8)) or right (to (6, 10)) are options, but both move the avatar away from any immediate threats like the thugs or the boss.\n\n### Planned Action\nThe most strategic action here involves moving downwards (to (7, 9)). This would allow a further exploration of the area while maintaining a safe distance from visible threats and leaving potential for future moves.\n\nLet's proceed with the following move:\n\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\n\nThis move will help explore lower parts of the map while being cautious.
