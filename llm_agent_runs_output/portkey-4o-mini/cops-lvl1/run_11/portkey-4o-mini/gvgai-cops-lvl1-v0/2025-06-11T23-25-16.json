The most strategic would be moving down as it opens up options to engage with the yellow thug (row=8, col=6) or head towards a different location.\n\n3. **Game Plan**: \n   - The downward move (row=7, col=6) leads to an open space and from there, the avatar can further navigate either left or downwards.
