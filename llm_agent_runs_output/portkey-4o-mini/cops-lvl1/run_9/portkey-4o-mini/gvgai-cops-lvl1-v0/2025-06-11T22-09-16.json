The jail (at row=6, col=1) is right above the avatar, which may lead to possible interactions with other thugs.\n2. There are several thugs (represented by * and $) below the avatar in rows 11 and 12. They need to be dealt with to gather points and resources.\n3.

The avatar should collect keys and defeat enemies to manage resources effectively.\n2. Prioritize defeating the closest enemies while remaining aware of the time limit.\n3. Each subsequent action needs to take into account the previous position and result.\n\nSince my avatar is currently at (6, 6) without any action taken in the last move, I will evaluate possible movements. \n\nThe immediate options:\n- I can either try to move towards the jail for potential resource interaction or position myself to face the red thugs for points.\n\nGiven the mechanics, moving towards the left (to (6, 5)) would open up possibilities for resource interaction while monitoring enemies.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action moves left towards (6, 5).
