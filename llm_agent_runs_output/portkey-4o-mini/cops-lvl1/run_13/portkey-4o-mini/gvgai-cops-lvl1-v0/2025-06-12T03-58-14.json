The game involves exploring a maze-like structure to collect resources and defeat enemies. \n\nAccording to the game rules and the available actions, the strategy emphasizes resource management and the careful navigation of the maze. Your next step should consider the current position and nearby resources or enemies.\n\nFrom the map layout, the area around you includes several walls (b) and open spaces (.). There's a depot (represented by '#') directly to the right at (6, 3) which could yield keys or resources, while the jail (represented by '%') is above you (5, 1). \n\nTo maximize efficiency and align with the suggested strategies, I recommend moving DOWN towards the depot where the jail door exists. This interaction is important for resource collection and future navigation.\n\nLet's proceed with the action:\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nMoving DOWN is expected to bring you closer to the depot for potential resource collection while remaining aware of the layout for a strategic approach."
