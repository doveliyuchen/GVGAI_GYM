I'm currently not adjacent to any enemies and can assess the surrounding areas. The jail doors can be opened with keys, which provide a strategic means of spawning different types of enemies.\n\n### Current Position Analysis:\n- Avatar is at (6, 6).\n- Directly above (5, 6) and below (7, 6) is open floor (.)\n- To the Left at (6, 5) and Right at (6, 7) are also open floors (.).\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Priority**: It would be ideal to check the jail (6, 1) for the potential key resources. \n2. **Action**: I'll move down to explore the area at (7, 6).\n\nGiven this reasoning, I choose to make the following action:\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action allows me to advance to an adjacent, open space (7, 6), thereby facilitating further exploration of the surroundings. I have exited the previous position, which aligns with the strategy of constant movement and resource acquisition strategy."

However, targeting a movement that also aligns with reaching a goal (such as a depot or a jail for resources) is wise.\n2. **Avoid Resource Loss**: Moving towards walls or positions occupied by thugs can lead to unnecessary resource loss. Given the previous game rules, the avatar must navigate carefully to avoid thugs from affecting the resource pool.\n\n### Decision:\nTo maintain flexibility, I will move the avatar **DOWN** to (7, 9) where there are no immediate threats and further explore for resources or keys.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action keeps options open as it leads to more exploration without losing any potential resources. I expect to see a clearer path to either collect keys or deal with nearby entities effectively."

Your avatar is positioned at (5, 9) on an open floor ('.').\n2. Nearby at (6, 1) there is a jail ('%'), which can potentially be opened using a key if you collect any.\n3. There are other locations like depots ('#') and the boss ('@') located below at (13, 1) and (14, 1).\n\n### Available Actions:\nThe current actions available to you are:\n- **ACTION_LEFT**: Move to (5, 8).\n- **ACTION_RIGHT**: Move to (5, 10).\n- **ACTION_DOWN**: Move to (6, 9).\n- **ACTION_UP**: Move to (4, 9).\n  \n### Move Analysis:\n- Moving **LEFT** to (5, 8) would still be on the open floor, but does not approach any key or resource.\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (5, 10) also keeps you on the floor but again does not provide immediate benefits.\n- Moving **DOWN** to (6, 9) remains on the floor but places you close to the depot at (6, 3) and generally into a more open area.\n- Moving **UP** to (4, 9), while it is still on the floor, may not provide as many long-term advantages since you are moving away from potential resources below.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nBased on these analyses and the overall strategy of prioritizing resource collection and positioning, the most prudent action is to move **DOWN** to the position (6, 9). This maintains good positioning while allowing for further exploration of the map for potential keys and interactions with the depots.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nI expect this action to align with the exploration strategy and potentially lead to resource acquisition or provide strategic movement toward defeating thugs and the boss."

The area directly beneath (row=6, col=11) is a wall.\n2. The area to the left (row=5, col=10) is also a wall.\n3. The areas above (row=4, col=11) and to the right (row=5, col=12) are both free spaces.\n\nSince going down or left is blocked, the most viable move is to go either up or right.

This would either lead to more exploration opportunities or potentially closer access to resources, as there are no other directions available.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will proceed with the following action:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving down seems to align with the objective of exploring the surroundings. I expect this will grant access to lower rows of the map for further opportunities to collect keys or defeat thugs."
