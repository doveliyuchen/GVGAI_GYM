However, there are no collectible resources in immediate reach based on the current layout. Moving left and right should reveal more of the environment and might allow you to plan your next step towards a key resource or villain.\n\n### Decision:\nI will take the action to move right which may open further pathways and options in the next turn.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nTo the right would open up new options while allowing you to stay out of threat from the thugs until you're ready to engage them."

Since the avatar is currently on (6, 6), it's optimal to either seek the nearest resource (the depot) or prep for dealing with the thugs.\n2.

This could lead to a scenario where I would need to move back down again or to another direction with less potential.\n- Moving **right (6, 6)** maintains progression through more of the empty tiles in the row and opens up further options for movement while keeping our avatar close to the regions where we may find resources or engage enemies.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will opt to move **right**.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action is expected to open up the next steps for exploration toward potential resources or enemy engagement while keeping options open for further movement towards the boss area."
