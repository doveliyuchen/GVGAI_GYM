Objectives:\n   - The strategy emphasized resource collection and management, combat with thugs, and avoidance of timeouts. \n   - The avatar should preferably move closer to either engage with the jail to spawn more resources or head towards the boss.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nSince there are significant enemies and mechanics below (i.e., the boss), I should move towards either the depot `#` to collect resources or the jail `%` to interact with it.
