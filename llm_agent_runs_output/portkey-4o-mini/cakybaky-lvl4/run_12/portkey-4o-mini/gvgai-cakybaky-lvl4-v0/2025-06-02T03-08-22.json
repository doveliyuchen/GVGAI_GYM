Moving right to (11, 2) is empty. Moving up to (10, 1) is empty as well.

Move **UP** to (10, 2) \u2014 This may not lead us toward the resources since it moves away from inc1.\n2. Move **DOWN** to (12, 2) \u2014 Similar reasoning as above.\n3.

Avoid confronting the chefs directly while collecting the resources.\n2. Assess movement options toward the resources in the correct order.\n\n### Action Decision:\nSince the avatar's last move strategy indicated moving towards the resources, we need to calculate a path that could lead toward either `inc1` or `inc2` while maintaining distance from the chefs. \n\nAnalyzing the layout of walls and tables, moving `up` may not be feasible due to the closely positioned walls above. \n\nConcluding the optimal strategy:\n```plaintext\nAction: ACTION_LEFT (2)\n```\n\n### Feedback:\nThis action allows a slight repositioning of the avatar away from direct confrontation with the chefs, potentially setting up for a future move towards the necessary resources. The expectation is to create a favorable distance to continue the sequence of resource collection while maintaining avoidance of the chef."
