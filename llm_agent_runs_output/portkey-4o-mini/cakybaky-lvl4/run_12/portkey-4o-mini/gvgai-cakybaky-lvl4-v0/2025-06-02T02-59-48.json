The immediate objective is to collect resources in the required order while avoiding the chef who can harm the character.\n\n**Analyzing the Environment:**\n- The avatar must follow the specific order to collect resources: Flour -> Milk -> Egg -> Sugar -> Butter -> Cherries.\n- The resources visible in the current area:\n  - Flour (`#`) is located at (1, 14) and (2, 22).\n  - Milk (`$`) is at (1, 4).\n  - Eggs (`%`) are at (2, 22) and (7, 18).\n  - Butter (`&`) is at (10, 17) (which I can collect after passing through the previous resources).\n  - Cherries (`c`) are located at (11, 23).\n\nThe closest item from the avatar's current position (10, 5) is not directly accessible without managing to get around the barriers (tables 'i') and the chef ('@'). \n\n**Immediate Actions:**\nTo avoid getting caught by the chef, I will take action to navigate towards the item, and considering that my current position does not change, I will aim to move carefully towards getting a resource. I will first check to see if I can move left to (10, 4) which would put me in a safer space away from the chef in this scenario.\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\nI expect to see the avatar move left to (10, 4) which will create more options for future moves while assessing placement away from the chef."

    "content": "In the current game state, my avatar ('a') is located at position (10, 4), and the first resource (which is flour indicated as '*') is at (10, 5). The chef ('@') is positioned at several places: at (1, 15), (1, 16), (2, 15), (2, 16), (3, 26), (3, 27), (4, 4), (5, 6), (11, 6), (12, 6), and (12, 14). \n\nSince the resource (flour) is directly to my right at (10, 5), I can smoothly collect it using the action to move right. Additionally, I need to ensure I keep track of the chef's movements to avoid being caught since there are multiple chefs closely surrounding the avatar.\n\nI will take the action to move right.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action should correctly collect the flour while keeping me safe from the chefs that are a couple of grid spaces away. I expect to see the flour collected and to remain in a safe position for my subsequent moves."

    "content": "Based on the current state, my avatar is positioned at (10, 5). The chef is located nearby at (4, 4), while several resources are present in the area. \n\n**Key items to collect in order:**\n1. Flour (not visible in the current map segment)\n2. Milk ($) at (1, 4)\n3. Egg (#) at (1, 14)\n4. Sugar (&) at (10, 17)\n5. Butter (not visible in the current map segment)\n6. Cherries (c) at (11, 23)\n\n### Current Analysis:\nTo adhere to the strategy:\n- I need to first look for the resources respecting the collection order.\n- The closest resource is milk, located directly above at (1, 4). \n- However, the chef's proximity to the avatar (4 rows up) poses a significant threat since the chef can approach quickly.\n\n### Suggested Action:\nMoving upwards from (10, 5) will place the avatar in the line of sight of the chef. Therefore, a better action would be to move to the right.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis movement will help to distance myself from the chef, providing more flexibility in future moves and potentially allowing me to collect resources that are farther ahead."
