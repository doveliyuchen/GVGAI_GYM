The next action to check would ideally involve moving towards (1, 4). In terms of game mechanics, our avatar needs to navigate around obstacles without encountering the chef's path.\n\n#### Action Chosen:\n1. Move **left** towards (11, 1) - which won't work since it doesn't move towards resources.\n2. Move **right** does not apply since it would go to (11, 3), which leads further away.\n3. Move **up** to (10, 2) seems better since it won't collide with obstacles, allowing evaluation of the next move directly toward collecting flour.\n\n### Conclusion:\nI will proceed with the action to move **up**.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving up to (10, 2) will allow me to reassess my position effectively while avoiding the chef.
