The sequence of resources to collect starts with Flour (inc1) which is represented by '#', and it is located at row 1, column 14. The immediate goal is to navigate toward this resource while avoiding the chef (represented by '@').\n\nThe chef is currently located at row 1, column 5 which is relatively close. I should plan my moves to avoid being caught while heading toward the Flour resource. The available movements from my current position (1,1) are:\n\n- LEFT (to row 1, column 0) which is a wall (t)\n- RIGHT (to row 1, column 2) which is empty (.)\n- DOWN (to row 2, column 1) which is empty (.)\n- UP (to row 0, column 1) which is a wall (t)\n\nThe best option to move forward is to go RIGHT to (1, 2) because both DOWN and RIGHT lead to empty spaces. Since this move does not place me directly next to the chef, it's a strategic choice.\n\nI will proceed with the RIGHT action.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action moves towards an open space, minimizing the risk of running into the chef while I'm progressing towards my first target resource efficiently."

The closest available resource to collect next, down the collection order, is the egg (`%` at (2, 22)), which can be reached after obtaining flour.\n\nAlso present nearby is the chef, represented by `@`, which is currently located at (2, 26). The tea and items in the vicinity should be maneuvered carefully to avoid collision with the chef.\n\nConsidering the mechanics and objective, the most productive action to take right now is to move **right** to (1, 3), with the goal of making progress toward viable resources while ensuring enough distance from the chef.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThe expectation is to create space and move closer to proper resources while remaining vigilant of the chef's movements."
