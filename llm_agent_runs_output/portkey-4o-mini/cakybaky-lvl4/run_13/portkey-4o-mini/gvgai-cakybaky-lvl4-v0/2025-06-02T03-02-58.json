    "content": "Given the current state of the game, your avatar is located at (4, 1). The first ingredient you need to collect is flour, located at (1, 14), and the second ingredient, milk, is at (1, 4). According to the strategy provided, you should collect the ingredients in the specified order while avoiding the chef and walls.\n\nThe current layout shows that there are a lot of walls (t) on the upper row and tables (i) nearby, which can help block the movement of the chef. This means you need to carefully plan your path to maximize resource collection while keeping a safe distance from the enemies.\n\n### Current Position Analysis\n- Your position: (4, 1)\n- Closest ingredient (Flour) position: (1, 14)\n- The chef is present at multiple positions, notably surrounding you at (2, 14), (2, 15), and (3, 26).\n\n### Proposed Movement\nFrom your current position (4, 1), moving directly up could lead you to a potential encounter with the chef, so a strategic movement to the right (to explore the available paths towards flour) can be considered.\n\n#### Action Plan:\n- Attempt an action to the right (towards (4, 2)).\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving to the right seems like a safe choice as it opens up exploration towards navigating through an area that may lead to resources without immediate confrontation with the chef."
