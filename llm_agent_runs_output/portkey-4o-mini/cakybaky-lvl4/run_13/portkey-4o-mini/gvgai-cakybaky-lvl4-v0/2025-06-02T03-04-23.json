Currently, the only visible resource is the Cherry at (11, 23).\n3. **Enemies**: There are chefs (represented by '@') in close proximity to the avatar at (11, 6), making moving in some directions risky.\n4. **Obstacles**: There are immovable tables ('i') and walls ('t') surrounding the player.\n\nBased on the current scenario:\n\n- The avatar is surrounded by walls and chefs.\n- The next resource (Cherry) is far to the right in row 11 at column 23.\n\nGiven the avatar's current position at (11, 1), the immediate actions could involve trying to move right, down, or possibly up.
