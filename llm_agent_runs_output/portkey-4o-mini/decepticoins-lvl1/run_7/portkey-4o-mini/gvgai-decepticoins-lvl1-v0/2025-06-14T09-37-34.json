The immediate action could be to move towards an area with collectible items while continuing to avoid walls and ensuring the piranha doesn't catch up.\n2. Since the goal is to eliminate the boxes, I can consider moving left since that would put me in position to either push a box into a hole or collect a coin.\n\n### Selected Action:\nI will move left from (5, 13) to (5, 12).\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nI expect this action to not only navigate the avatar closer to potential coins but also to position myself strategically without encountering any walls or hazards."
