Also, I must ensure not to get cornered if the enemy appears since the main concern is to stay alive while progressing.\n\n### Strategic Move Decision\nGiven the available options, I choose to move **left** to (5, 6) as it keeps me in a position to assess the board further, without moving closer to any boxes yet.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left is a safe choice and keeps my options open for the next turn since I will have a clear view of what to do next."
