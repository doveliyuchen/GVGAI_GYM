The closest significant feature nearby is the box ('@') located at (5, 16), which could be used to navigate through holes or switches if needed later.\n\n### Current Strategy:\n- From the position (5, 7), we can either move left or right to explore:\n  - Moving left to (5, 6) puts the avatar in a new position but does not bring us closer to any immediate objectives.\n  - Moving right to (5, 8) keeps us in a range of movement, potentially giving us options to check the surroundings more effectively.\n\n### Action Decision:\nGiven that previous movement is not specified, we will optimize our next action based on moving towards a direction that opens possibilities to either collect coins or interact further with the environment.\n\nConsidering the options:\n- **Left (to 5,6):** Empty space.\n- **Right (to 5,8):** Empty space.\n  \nThe action that seems to derive from this analysis would be to move **right (to 5,8)** as it keeps the avatar actively engaged in exploring available options.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action will allow the avatar to explore the surrounding space further which may lead to attaining coins or manipulating boxes later."
