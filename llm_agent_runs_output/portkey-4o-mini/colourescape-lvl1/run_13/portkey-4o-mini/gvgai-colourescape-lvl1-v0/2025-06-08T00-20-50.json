The nearest significant interaction point is a green switch (@) at (2, 2) which might affect my movement or ability to reach the exit.\n4. My immediate surroundings show that the way upward is blocked by walls (r). Therefore, I need to move horizontally or manipulate the layout via the boxes.\n\n### Current Strategy:\nSince my position is static, I need to take action to ensure progress. The available immediate actions are to move left or right. Moving right (to col 8) is open (to '*', a greenbox), which could facilitate future moves toward the box interactions.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven all of this information, I will execute the action to move right.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis move is strategic as it opens up interactions with a green box, providing the potential for further navigation upwards toward the exit. I expect the interaction with the green box to be advantageous in achieving my goal of navigating closer to the exit."

The available actions include movement in four directions, but it\u2019s pertinent to note wall collisions, which restrict movement.\n\nNow, I need to choose an action:\n- Moving **left (to 9, 6)** would be fine as it's a floor.\n- Moving **right (to 9, 8)** puts me on a green box, but doesn't lead directly towards the exit.\n- Moving **up (to 8, 7)** is also unobstructed, leading to floor space.\n- Moving **down (to 10, 7)** isn't possible because of the wall.\n\nGiven that the objective is to find the most effective route towards the exit while also maximizing movement without getting stuck, I will choose to move **up (to 8, 7)**. This move leads up to a floor tile which keeps options open for future moves towards the exit.\n\n### Proposed Action\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis actionmoves vertically up to row 8, keeping options open without hitting obstacles, which aligns with our strategy to navigate toward the exit effectively."

The strategies include avoiding holes, efficiently managing interactions with boxes, and transforming with switches. \n\nThe goal should be to move towards interaction points that would allow for bouncing or pushing boxes as necessary. However, currently, there is no urgency as the avatar is safe.\n\n### Selected Action:\nSince the avatar can move freely and there is no immediate obstruction or interaction needed in the adjacent squares except moving up to continue toward the exit area, moving up is a sensible first step.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis upward move to (row=7, col=7) should keep the strategy aligned with maximizing movement towards the exit. After this move, I will check for more potential interactions or pathways."

Moving down (row 8, col 7) is an option into an empty space, but moving right is also an option, though it would require manipulating the red box in that direction.\n\nThe best immediate action is to move **down** as it opens up new possibilities in the empty area below while also keeping the option to explore to the right for potential interactions.\n\n### Action Decision:\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis is a strategic move down into an empty cell, opening up further options for the next turn while also avoiding any immediate risks associated with the holes or walls.
