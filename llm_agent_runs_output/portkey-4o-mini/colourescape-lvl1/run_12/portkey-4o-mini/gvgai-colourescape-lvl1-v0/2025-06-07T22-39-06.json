Therefore, it's crucial to use available transforms or switches to interact with boxes to either create paths or gain new abilities.\n\n### Proposed Action\nGiven that no movement can be made at this point, we should try interacting with the closest switch available. The green switch can be utilized if we move up to (6, 1).\n\n### Action Decision\nBased on the strategic advice to utilize switches effectively to solve the puzzles, the following action will be taken:\n\n``` \nAction:1 \n```\n\nThis action will not succeed in changing the avatar's position immediately as it is blocked, but changing the direction could eventually help interact with other elements.

The avatar ('e') is located at (8, 11), near several interactive elements such as boxes, switches, a hole (h), and the exit (%).\n2. The immediate area around the avatar indicates possible movement directions with walls (r) blocking certain paths.\n\nConsidering the goal is to reach the exit and avoid holes, the logical next action would be to assess whether moving in any of the four directional options (left, right, up, down) could provide a potential route to the exit or activate necessary elements for progression.\n\n### Observations:\n- Up (to (7, 11)) or Down (to (9, 11)) would keep the avatar in a relatively open area but do not lead directly toward the exit.\n- Moving left (to (8, 10)) is blocked by a wall (r).\n- Moving right (to (8, 12)) is also blocked by more walls (there's a wall at (8, 12)).\n\nWith the above analysis, there are currently no available movements that will lead closer to the exit based on direct blocks. Therefore, it is crucial to consider any power-ups or transformations (like switches) that can potentially affect movement.\n\n### Suggested Action: \nSince all immediate directional movement options are blocked, the chosen action must involve interactions with nearby switches or maintaining the position to decide on a better next move, as repeating the current action (which resulted in no movement) might help re-evaluate the surroundings.\n\nProceeding with the following direction for potential interaction with the surrounding elements is critical to exploring the nearby switches effectively. \n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nI expect this move to explore the immediate vertical state in case it allows interaction with the switches or blocks that can help navigate toward the exit based on the strategic outline."

Currently, the avatar must decide on an action that will lead to meaningful progress.\n\n1. The action options available are `LEFT (1)`, `RIGHT (2)`, `UP (4)`, `DOWN (3)`, or `NIL (0)`.\n  \nSince the avatar is surrounded by walls on the left and below but has open paths to the right and potentially up towards the exit, I will first attempt to move right to see if there's an open path that can be leveraged further.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action is expected to allow the avatar to advance towards a corridor, enabling further movements in future steps towards reaching the exit."

    "content": "Given the current game state and our position within the level, the avatar is located at (row=6, col=8), which is represented by 'e'. The surrounding tiles include boxes, walls, switches, holes, and the exit.\n\n### Analysis of Surroundings:\n- **Current Position**: (6, 8) - Avatar on normal floor.\n- **Nearby Elements**:\n  - (5, 8): Box ('$')\n  - (7, 8): Hole ('n')\n  - (6, 7): Empty floor ('.')\n  - (6, 9): Empty floor ('.')\n\n### Evaluation of Actions:\n1. **Move Left (to 6, 7)**: This is an empty tile, which is safe and would allow for further exploration.\n2. **Move Right (to 6, 9)**: Also an empty tile, similarly safe.\n3. **Move Up (to 5, 8)**: This would place the avatar on a box, which might lead to further actions depending on the game mechanics regarding boxes.\n4. **Move Down (to 7, 8)**: This would place the avatar in a hole, resulting in a negative score.\n\n### Strategic Decision:\nAs we want to avoid the hole at (7, 8) and both left and right options are safe, it would be wise to explore the area. Moving left (to (6, 7)) appears to be a sound choice since it opens potential movement for future turns without immediately complicating the situation.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left is a strategic decision to explore further while avoiding hazards like holes, ensuring the avatar's safety."
