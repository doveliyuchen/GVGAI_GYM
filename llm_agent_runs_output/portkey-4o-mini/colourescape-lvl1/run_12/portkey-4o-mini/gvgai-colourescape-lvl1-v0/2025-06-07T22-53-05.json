Based on the place of the objects described in the grid layout, we need to make a strategic decision on where to move next.\n\n### Properties of Interest\n- **Switches**: We see two switches: one at `(2,2)` (`@`, blue switch) and another at `(7,1)` (`&`, green switch). Depending on the action taken, using these switches could change the form of the avatar.\n- **Boxes**: There are multiple boxes scattered, such as blue boxes (`#`), red boxes (`$`), and green boxes (`*`). The potential to use these boxes to block holes or reach the exit effectively is crucial.\n- **Hazards**: There are holes (`h`) that can lead to losing the avatar, specifically located at `(5,8)`, `(8,15)`, etc.\n\n### Strategic Movements\nThe strategic option would depend on:\n1. Making effective use of the switches.\n2. Reaching the exit, indicated by the `%`.\n3. Avoiding the holes while positioning the avatar to solve puzzles involving the boxes.\n\nGiven that the position does not change it implies we either need to rotate or simply no move was made. Assuming the last action didn't result in any progress and may have just rotated, we should attempt a directional move.\n\n### Deciding the Action\nWith this information, I would check the areas around the avatar and see where the safest and most logical action is. If we are near a switch or opening, moving towards that could be advantageous.\n\n### Proposed Action\nGiven all of this, a reasonable action might be to move Left, Right, Up, or Down, depending on the current avatar position which I don't possess at the moment but leaning towards exploration with maximum safety in mind. \n\nIf I assume the face toward a switch (#) without knowing for certain where the avatar is positioned:\n\n``` \nAction: 2 (ACTION_RIGHT)\n```\n\n**Feedback on the Action**: I expect this move will either bring the avatar closer to a switch or open space for maneuvering, aligning with our strategic goal of navigating to the exit efficiently while exploring switches and utilizing box interactions."

It is crucial to ensure the avatar does not get stuck without options while aiming to reach the exit.\n\nNext, I will assume the last known position of your avatar is `(1, 3)` based on the color-coded switch tile `g`. To make progress, it might be wise to step onto the switch or explore adjacent empty spaces.

The avatar is positioned next to a green switch at (row 7, col 1) and can utilize that switch to change form.\n\nSince the avatar's current position (the green switch, indicated by '&') is adjacent to a possible action, let's consider how to use that switch to potentially gain an advantage. \n\nBased on the mechanics provided, if I activate the green switch, my avatar will likely change to a green avatar which may have unique abilities beneficial for navigating the level. \n\nThus, my next action is:\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nI expect this action to activate the switch, change my avatar's form, and potentially aid in solving subsequent puzzles or mitigate hazards as I navigate toward the exit."

If the avatar is green, interacting with this switch will be necessary to either move a box or enable the avatar to perform specific actions.\n3. **Navigating Carefully**: Ensure to avoid the holes, noting their positions to safely maneuver around them.\n\n### Action Decision:\nGiven there is no specified avatar position, I will infer the need to interact with the switch first as alteration of avatar state may be beneficial. The action that leads to engaging with the switch at (2, 2) is the most beneficial at this moment.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \nThis action should result in the avatar moving right towards the switch and activating it.

Determine my position first (which has not been explicitly stated).\n2. If I am near any of the switches, I will consider switching forms to interact with boxes or reach the exit better.\n\nAssuming I am at row 1, col 1 (for example) and I see a box to my right (at row 1, col 2), I will try to evaluate actions from that position to continue making progress toward the exit.\n\n### Choosing Action\nIf I rotate and aim to move right and my avatar does not move, I would have to perform a second right motion to ensure I move in the desired direction.\n\nSince I do not have enough information about my exact position, I will prepare for a right move if that aligns with the strategy of progressing through boxes and switches towards the exit.\n\n**Assuming I am at position (1,1) (just for the sake of taking action)**:\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\nThis action would be a right move, indicating my avatar aims to navigate through boxes and reach the exit efficiently. I am expecting to see the avatar move closer to a box to interact with or potentially uncover new pathways towards the exit on the next turn."
