This indicates that movement options are very limited.\n- The greenbox can be interacted with, but considering that there are walls on three sides, movement options will need to be focused on interactions with the greenbox or trying to find another path if necessary.\n\n### Next Action\nSince there is no path available on the left (blocked by a wall), no upward movement (blocked by a wall), and downward movement is also blocked. The only interaction available is to the right with the greenbox.\n\n**Action**: Moving right to engage with the greenbox could potentially open up new possibilities thereafter.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate action to take is to move to the right:\n\n``` \nAction:2 \n```\n\nFeedback: Moving right will allow the avatar to engage with the greenbox, creating potential opportunities to work with other elements on the board and further navigate towards the exit."

Starting actions will revolve around navigating to the green switch at position (7, 1), which could potentially enhance or open further pathways.\n2. Monitoring the state change after interactions will be crucial, especially since moving next to a box or a switch may change the environment in ways that could lead to success or failure.\n\n### Determined Action\nBased on this analysis, I will step to the left towards the green switch to utilize this interaction for possible color change.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action will help me get closer to activating the green switch, potentially allowing me to manipulate the surrounding sprites favorably on the next turn.

If my last action did not yield any movement, I need to explore a new direction aiming for the exit or a switch.\n\nNow I will choose a direction, assuming I was near the exit row.

If it's blue, it may interact differently with certain boxes.\n3. **Next Possible Moves**: Look for spaces (floors) to move onto that won't lead to immediate penalties (like falling into a hole).\n\n### Immediate Action\nSince the avatar's specific position isn't provided, I would be making a general assumption. Let's say the avatar is at (2, 2) based on usual puzzle patterns, right next to a blue switch (marked '@'). The available options are:\n- UP to (1, 2) on the normal floor ('.')\n- DOWN to (3, 2) on a wall ('r'), which is invalid.\n- RIGHT to (2, 3), which is a hole ('b'), causing loss.\n- LEFT to (2, 1), which is a normal floor ('.')\n\n### Selected Action\nGiven this assessment, moving LEFT to (2, 1) appears to be a safe route to avoid penalties.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nFeedback: Moving left keeps my avatar safe and enables me to reassess my options without falling into holes or touching walls.

For the sake of this interpretation, I will assume the avatar is at (2, 2) based on the surrounding context, as you have a blue switch ('@') right next to it.\n\n### Analyzing the Environment\n- Adjacent positions to the avatar:\n  - Up (1, 2): empty (.)\n  - Down (3, 2): wall (r)\n  - Left (2, 1): empty (.)\n  - Right (2, 3): blue switch (@)\n\nGiven that the avatar's immediate right is the blue switch, interacting with it is crucial. The strategy revolves around using the switch effectively, potentially transforming the avatar type.\n\n### Action Plan\n1. **Interact with the Blue Switch (@)**: This will likely rotate or change the avatar to a blue avatar ('f'), which could offer different interactions with the next elements.\n2. Due to the lack of clear alternatives for movement, transforming via the switch is the optimal move as the exit is still several moves away.\n\n### Proposed Action\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action moves to the right and activates the blue switch, expecting a transformation of the avatar that will open up new movement options and interactions. This aligns with the strategy of utilizing transformations wisely to reach the exit."

Moving right could also potentially yield an interaction with the next blueSwitch or possibly a new action.\n- As the strategy suggests, we should be thoughtful about the effects of switching colors/types; being on a blueSwitch would allow us to manipulate interactions with boxes or obstacles in a way that could open up pathways to reach the exit.\n\n### Decision\nSince the avatar's position does not change if I choose to move left or down, it might be more strategic to activate the next switch to see how that affects my interaction options. \n\nConsidering these factors, I will move **right** first to step on the next blueSwitch.

So, let's analyze the position of my avatar (represented by 'f').\n\n### Current Avatar Position:\n- Row 4, Column 5 (`(4, 5)`)\n\n### Nearby Sprites:\n- Up `(3, 5)`: wall (r)\n- Down `(5, 5)`: an empty spot (.)\n- Left `(4, 4)`: blue switch (@)\n- Right `(4, 6)`: an empty spot (.)\n\n### Nearby Boxes and Exits:\n- The closest exit, `%`, is at position `(2, 16)` which is not easily accessible directly.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Switch**: Stepping on the blue switch at `(4, 4)` may allow for transformations, which can influence my interactions with other boxes and sprites.\n2. **Movement Options**: The only available moves from my current position `(4, 5)` are left `(4, 4)` to the blue switch or down `(5, 5)` to an empty spot.\n\n### Suggested Action:\nActivating the blue switch should be a priority since it allows an immediate transformation and opens up more options for manipulating surrounding sprites. Therefore, I will move left to the blue switch.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nFeedback: Moving left to the blue switch allows potential transformations crucial for navigating through the level, establishing a strategic advantage."

The key objects of interest include walls, switches, boxes, exit points, and holes.\n\n### Current Position Analysis\nBased on the provided map, the avatar is positioned at `(2, 2)`, which corresponds to the blue switch (`@`) on the map. The immediate surroundings are:\n- Up `(1, 2)`: empty (`.`)\n- Down `(3, 2)`: wall (`r`)\n- Left `(2, 1)`: empty (`.`)\n- Right `(2, 3)`: hole (`b`)\n\n### Next Action Reasoning\n1. **Current Avatar Position**: The avatar is positioned on a blue switch, which allows it to transform into a blue avatar (`f`) after stepping on it.\n2. **Available Moves**: The avatar can move left, right, or down but moving up or down will not be fruitful due to either walls or holes.\n3. **Exit Strategy**: The goal is to reach the exit (`%`) located at `(2, 16)`. To reach this exit, the avatar will need to navigate through the available spaces while avoiding the hole to the right and focusing on moving toward the exit.\n\nGiven the current state and the opportunity to transform into the blue avatar by stepping onto the blue switch, the most logical action is to attempt to move left, as that maintains the avatar's position on the blue switch.\n\nHere's the action I will take based on the analysis:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action moves right into a hole. The expectation is to align with the strategy of avoiding holes while planning ahead for future movements."
