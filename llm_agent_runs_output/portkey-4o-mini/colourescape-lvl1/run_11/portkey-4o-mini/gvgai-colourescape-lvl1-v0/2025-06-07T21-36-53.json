There is a green switch at `(7, 1)` and a blue switch at `(2, 2)` which can alter the avatar's properties, possibly helping advance to the exit.\n\n### Previous Action Analysis\nIf the avatar's position has not changed between actions, this indicates either a rotation occurred or an action was ineffective due to obstacles.

    "content": "To determine the appropriate action, we need to analyze the current state of the game. From the layout provided, it appears that the avatar's position is not indicated, but based on the game mechanics and environment, we can infer some immediate actions.\n\n### Analyzing Possible Actions\n1. **Current Avatar Position**: Since the avatar position isn't explicitly mentioned, I will assume a general position.\n2. **Surrounding Terrain**: Based on the map, I observe many walls ('r'), open spaces ('.'), boxes ('$', '#', '*', 'n'), switch-based manipulations, and a clear exit ('%').\n3. **Goal**: The primary focus is to reach the exit while avoiding hazards like holes ('h') or previously mentioned issues that cause avatars to be lost.\n\n### Available Actions\n- Since the avatar needs to navigate towards an exit, I need to assess which direction can be taken.\n- If the action needed is immediate, I'd consider the potential spaces around a starting avatar position near a box or switch to think of the next strategic move.\n\nGiven that action 0 (ACTION_NIL) does nothing, I will opt for an action that is relevant to potential movement toward the objective or adjusting towards a necessary box interaction.\n\n### Decision\nSince the avatar may need to position itself strategically in relation to the boxes and switches nearby (such as the blue switch at (2,2) and the presence of various boxes), I will take the action to move **right** (given that moving left might not be advantageous if there are walls).\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action aims to position the avatar in a more advantageous spot, either to manipulate boxes or prepare for future movements towards the exit, supporting the strategy of navigating spaces efficiently."

    "content": "To determine the next action, we first need to analyze the current player avatar location in relation to the available action options and the overall layout.\n\n### Current Avatar Position\nThe player avatar is represented by 'e'. Based on the provided map:\n- The avatar ('e') is at row 2, col 2. \n\n### Understanding Surroundings\nLooking at the surrounding tiles:\n- Row 1, Col 2: `.`\n- Row 3, Col 2: `r`\n- Row 2, Col 1: `.`\n- Row 2, Col 3: `@` (blue switch)\n\n### Available Actions\n1. **Move LEFT (2,1)**: This will move to an empty space (`.`).\n2. **Move RIGHT (2,3)**: This will activate the blue switch (`@`).\n3. **Move UP (1,2)**: This will move to another empty space (`.`).\n4. **Move DOWN (3,2)**: This move is into a wall (`r`), which is not allowed.\n\n### Strategy Choice\nBased on the analysis, I have two immediate choices to make: moving left or activating the blue switch by moving right. However, activating the blue switch may provide an advantage depending on its function. \n\nGiven the game's mechanics, activating the blue switch may transform the avatar into a blue version, perhaps giving access to further boxes or routes. Consequently, moving right to `(2,3)` is advantageous.\n\nThus, I will choose to:\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\nMoving right to activate the blue switch should provide strategic benefits, aligning with the goal of progressing in the game towards the exit."

The area above contains a wall (`r`) at `row=5, col=9`.\n- The objective is to reach the exit represented by `%` at `row=2, col=16`. Our primary task will be to manipulate boxes and to activate switches effectively.\n\n### Current State:\n- The avatar has not moved in the last turn, indicating the need for a decisive action. \n\n### Available Actions:\n1. Moving left would attempt to position the avatar towards another box but ultimately this will not progress towards the exit.\n2. Moving right has the potential of pushing or interacting with the box ahead.\n3. The potential to move down is limited since there are obstacles.\n4. Moving up hits a wall.\n\n### Decision:\nMoving **RIGHT** (action `2`) seems to be the most promising move. This will allow the avatar to interact with the box in front and potentially set up future moves towards the exit.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving right towards the box will allow me to assess and manipulate the available blocks effectively in upcoming turns towards reaching the exit."

    "content": "Based on the current state of the game, we can see that the avatar, represented as 'f', is located at row 6, column 9. The surrounding environment indicates various hazards, obstacles, and boxes that may be interactable. There are green switches ('&') at (7,1), normal switches ('g') at (1,3), holes represented by 'h', which can result in a score loss, and exit ('%') at (2,16). \n\nThe current objective is to navigate towards the exit while managing boxes and avoiding hazards. Since the position of the avatar hasn't changed, we should perform a directional action that can potentially explore or manipulate the current environment.\n\nConsidering the layout around the avatar:\n- To the left (row 6, col 8) is a box ('$').\n- To the right (row 6, col 10) is also a box ('$').\n- Moving up (row 5, col 9) is a normal floor ('.').\n- Down (row 7, col 9) is a wall ('r').\n\nWe can move up to explore potential strategies with the boxes or aim to progress towards the exit by maneuvering around hazards.\n\nSince the preferred direction is to search for the exit and there are boxes blocking immediate paths, I will move upwards.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nI'm choosing to move up as I want to explore the upper section for more options to reach the exit, and this aligns with my strategy of evaluating the surrounding area."
