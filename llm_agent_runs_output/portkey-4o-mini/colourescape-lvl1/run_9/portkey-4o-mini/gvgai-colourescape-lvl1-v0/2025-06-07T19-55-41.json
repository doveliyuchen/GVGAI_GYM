If nothing else, it can help clarify if this location leads to avenues for progress.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\n\nFeedback: Moving left to the blue box (8, 7) will allow for exploration of this sprite's interaction potential on my avatar's capabilities, aligning with our strategy of using interactions effectively."
