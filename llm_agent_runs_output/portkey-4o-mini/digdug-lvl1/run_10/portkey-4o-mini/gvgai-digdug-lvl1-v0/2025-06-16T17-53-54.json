It would be prudent to either collect nearby goodies or move towards the entrance (14, 14) and avoid direct contact with the monster.\n- The goal of collecting goodies remains, and since there are no immediate threats except the monster, avoiding it is essential for survival.\n\n### Next Action\nThe best course of action is to move down to (14, 4), as it would allow the avatar to move closer to the entrance while managing the threat of the nearby monster.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nMoving down will help avoid monster confrontation while positioning the avatar to explore further options from the new location.
