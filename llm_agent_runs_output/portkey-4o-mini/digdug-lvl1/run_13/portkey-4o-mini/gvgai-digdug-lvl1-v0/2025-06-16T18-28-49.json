The available actions are directional movements and interactions with objects (like using items). \n\n### Analyzing the Current Situation\n- **Nearby Threats:** You are currently adjacent to two monsters: one at `(13, 14)` and another at `(13, 17)`. Approaching these monsters directly would be risky.\n- **Goals:** The aim is to collect gems and gold while avoiding or strategically dealing with monsters. Currently, there are gems available at `(1, 23)`, `(4, 22)`, `(5, 4)`, `(6, 12)`, `(6, 14)`, and at the positions of `(8, 12)` and `(8, 14)`. There\u2019s also gold at `(0, 4)`, `(0, 18)`, with the latter being adjacent to a wall.\n- **Immediate Options:** Moving towards the gems while avoiding the monsters is a priority. The most immediate gem that you can reach would be at `(4, 22)`, but you would require a safe path to navigate without being attacked.\n\nGiven the threats in proximity and the potential gain from gems, it's safer to move away from the current threats.\n\n### Deciding the Action\nMoving left (`ACTION_LEFT` or 2) will take you to `(13, 3)`, which is a safe floor position. This action will allow you to create some distance from the monsters without directly engaging.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis move helps to maintain distance from the monsters while I can assess the next steps towards collecting more gems safely."
