However, the goals are to collect goodies (gems or gold) while avoiding monsters.\n\n### Nearby Areas\nFrom the current position:\n- **Up (11, 5)**: Wall ('&')\n- **Down (13, 5)**: Free floor ('.')\n- **Left (12, 4)**: Free floor ('.')\n- **Right (12, 6)**: Free floor ('&')\n\n**Nearby Goodies**:\n- **Gems ('#')** are located at (1, 23), (4, 21), (5, 4), (8, 12), (7, 13), and (12, 21 \u2013 another one) based on the layout scan. \n\n**Monsters**:\n- Nearby monsters (% and @) are present at (1, 4), (2, 6), and at (13, 14).\n\n### Analysis on Actions\nIn this scenario, the avatar cannot stay idle, and here are considered actions:\n1. We can move **Down (to 13, 5)**, which keeps the avatar safe while potentially allowing for further movement opportunities.\n2. Moving **Left (to 12, 4)** moves towards a free spot, setting a step to potentially navigate around while staying safe.\n3.

This helps not only to navigate the board but allows more exploration in future moves. \n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action keeps the avatar moving towards a safer area while preparing to strategize for the next move."

Moving **up** (to (11, 3)) or **down** (to (13, 3)) are the only viable options without risking a collision.
