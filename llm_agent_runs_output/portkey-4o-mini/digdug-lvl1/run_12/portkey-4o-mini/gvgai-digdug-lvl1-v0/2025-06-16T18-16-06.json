Currently, I see that the area directly above (row 13) contains a monster (%), but there are some potential pathways and goodies nearby.\n\nTo begin moving toward collecting a nearby gem (#) at (12, 21) and avoid immediate danger:\n1. **Moving Up** to (13, 5) will still be relatively close, offering strategic spacing from the enemy.\n2. After assessing, I might continue to navigate up from that position or potentially maneuver left or right depending on visibility of further goodies while keeping track of the monsters.\n\nSince the avatar currently faces no immediate walls directly above and I want to maintain flexibility while progressing, I will choose the upward action for the moment.\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis upward move is expected to keep me strategically safe while moving closer to potential collectibles."
