The strategy suggests exploring the level and using switches wisely, particularly the blue switch, which transforms the avatar into the blue avatar represented as 'w'.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I will act in the direction towards the blue switch which is to the right of my presumed position. \n\nI'll choose the following action:\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action moves the avatar to the right toward the blue switch, which aligns with experimenting with the mechanics of transformation to progress in the level.

The exit is located at (1, 11).\n\nCurrently, the important items near the avatar at (6, 16) are as follows:\n- Above it at (5, 16) is an empty space.\n- Below it at (7, 16) is a wall ('h').\n- To the left at (6, 15) is a box ('$').\n- To the right at (6, 17) is a hole ('h').\n\nSince there is a box to the left, I can potentially move the avatar to interact with it. However, if the avatar rotates, it may not affect the position at this moment. Therefore, executing an action to move left first will help me understand if subsequent movements can be made effectively.\n\nI will take the action to move left towards the box.\n\n``` Action:1 ``` \n\nI expect to see the avatar positioned at (6, 15) and ready to interact with the box, aligning with the strategy of manipulating elements to progress towards the exit."
