If the avatar is near switches or boxes, those can be good next steps.\n2. **Utilize Transformations and Switches:** If there are colored switches nearby, stepping on them can give access to new forms that may be necessary for progressing towards the exit.\n3. **Avoid Loss Conditions:** Ensure that the avatar does not step into holes (`&`) which would incur the penalty.\n\n### Next Move Decision:\nAssuming the avatar's last known action (not explicitly stated) hasn't resulted in movement since we're analyzing it based on the current snapshot of the grid, the game dictates that action is required to proceed. \n\nSince there are clear paths directly toward the exit and considering rotation mechanics might be involved, let's first move **right** towards possible interactions, which would need to be evaluated visually based on the movement to see if it results in a change in state.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \nThis action would ideally position the avatar to check nearby elements (like the exit) further while hoping it aligns with the overall strategy to reach the exit quickly."

The primary strategy is to aim towards reaching that exit without falling into any holes. \n\n### Current Analysis\n\n- The avatar needs to navigate through various types of floors.\n- There are holes in multiple areas, specifically in the first two rows and at various columns throughout the map.\n- Paths are available, with multiple boxes and switches spread throughout.\n\nGiven that I must make a move while confirming that the avatar hasn't been in the same position previously, can you indicate where the avatar might be positioned? If not clearly stated, I may need to select an action based on other sprites available around me.\n\nIn existing actions:\n- Action 0 (ACTION_NIL) does not lead to any change.\n- I should anticipate action directions based on where the avatar could potentially have moved.\n\nTo proceed, I will make a move to the right (ACTION_RIGHT). This will help me explore horizontally for potential routes while keeping an eye on nearby holes to avoid loss.\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nI expect this action to allow the avatar to interact further with the environment and potentially position itself closer to the exit, avoiding holes and using boxes effectively."

Areas with '.' are passable, and I may have to look for switches (@, b, c, d) to transform the avatar.\n\nSince there is no explicit position mentioned for the avatar, I can take the first action to move down (to row 1, col 1) where the first accessible spot (.) is available. The move would seem valid based on standard starting gameplay.\n\nThus, I will perform:\n\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\n\nMoving down should keep me clear of holes and lead to more options to explore or interact.

Since the action set does not include a direct action for activating the switch, I'll simply execute a directional action twice to ensure the avatar successfully interacts with the switch once it is rotated toward it.\n\n**Action Selection:** \nSince my initial plan was influenced by the need to confirm and manage space around the blue switch, I choose to execute a downward movement first to reach the environment clearly around the switch.\n\n```Action: 0```\n\nThis action is aimed at evaluating the state for any needed transformation or adjustment before proceeding based on immediate surroundings, which aligns with strategic considerations of managing interactions correctly."

We need to assume an initial position that allows for movement. \n2. **Obstacles:** Surrounding the possible position, we can see holes (represented by **'h'**), which pose a threat, and a mix of box types (e.g., **'1'**, **'2'**, **'3'**, **'4'**). \n3. **Objectives:** The exit is at (1, 11) denoted by **'%'**. The layout is primarily filled with holes, making navigation quite tricky.\n\n#### Strategy Evaluation:\nFollowing the strategies:\n- **Explore the Level:** We must ensure that we know which way to navigate without falling into holes.\n- **Box Management:** Utilizing the boxes effectively can help the avatar bounce to strategic positions.\n- **Transformations:** Utilize any available switches to potentially change the avatar's form, which may be necessary depending on the obstacles.\n\nSince the current position of the avatar is not provided within the ordinary map reference, let\u2019s assume the avatar can initially move right to either start towards opening more possible routes or to access available switches to facilitate transformation.\n\n#### Selected Action:\nGiven the layout and the best immediate direction towards avoiding holes while considering the exit location, I will execute:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action is moving to the right, as this should allow for exploring more viable paths and getting closer to any boxes or tools needed to progress.
