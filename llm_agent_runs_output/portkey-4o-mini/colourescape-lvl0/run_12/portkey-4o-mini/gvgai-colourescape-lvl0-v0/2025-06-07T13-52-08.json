I anticipate this will help navigate through to reach the exit more effectively while avoiding pitfalls."

Another safe option.\n\n### Strategy Reflection:\n- The primary goal is to avoid risk moving toward obstacles and aim for open spaces first. The avatar has two clear movements downward or to the left/right where no obstacles exist.\n\n### Recommendation:\nIn this case, moving directly towards unblocked space is key. While both LEFT and RIGHT yield similar outcomes, moving RIGHT keeps the avatar in proximity to explore towards the exit line without engaging with boxes immediately.\n\nThus, my action will be:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action allows for maximal flexibility while keeping the avatar safe from immediate obstacles, thus adhering well to the outlined strategy."

Our goal is to navigate towards the exit (denoted by `%`) located at (1, 11). The immediate surroundings are obstructed by holes (denoted by `&`) and walls (denoted by `h`), but there are also boxes (`$`, `#`) and switch mechanisms nearby that may be useful.\n\nGiven the strategic objective of planning moves as per the game rules:\n1. **Check surroundings**: The avatar can move to adjacent spaces but must avoid holes. The only viable immediate action is to explore the area in order to progress toward the exit.\n2. **Assess available actions**: The possible actions to move left, right, up, or down must be evaluated based on whether they will move the avatar toward the exit or give access to useful elements such as switches or boxes that can aid navigation.\n\n### Strategy based on Condition:\n- The avatar can either navigate out of the current row or see what actions are available by manipulating the environment with the boxes.\n- Since the row (6, 9) allows for movement potentially to the left (6, 8), right (6, 10 which is clear), or down (7, 9 which is a hole). Moving right to (6, 10) is the optimal choice as it leads to an unoccupied space.\n\n### Selected Action:\nGiven that my last action did not change my position from (6,9), I will proceed to move right into a free space at (6, 10):\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action should help advance my position towards solving the puzzle and getting closer to the exit, as I expect it will leave me in a better position to either utilize the switch or explore more options."

Since there are boxes above, moving up could potentially allow us to reach the exit area more effectively.\n2. We should avoid moving down to (6, 8) since it's an empty space without significant progression.\n3. Moving left appears to have no benefit either as it does not lead towards the exit.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I will move up to (4, 8).\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action aims to take advantage of the box mechanics above to potentially progress further towards the exit.

The exit is directly above the avatar, so ideally, moving upwards is encouraged.\n\nHowever, close inspection of the current map layout reveals that directly above the avatar at (4, 11) is a wall (`h`), preventing a direct upward movement. The next possible strategic movements include navigating left or right:\n\n- The left (5, 10) is a clear path (`.`).\n- The right (5, 12) is also a clear path (`.`).\n\nSince both left and right are valid options leading to an ultimately clear area, I can opt to move left to (5, 10). This will allow evaluating further movements from there while progressing toward the exit indirectly.\n\nThus, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` \nAction:1 \n```\n\nThis will provide a clear direction to explore while moving left and preparing for subsequent strategic decisions. I expect that this action will position the avatar better towards determining the next viable move toward the exit, further maintaining momentum in the gameplay strategy."
