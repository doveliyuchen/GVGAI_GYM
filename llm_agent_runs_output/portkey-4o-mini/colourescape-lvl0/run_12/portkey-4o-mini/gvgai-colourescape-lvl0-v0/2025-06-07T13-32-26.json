From your current position, you can move left (to 6,8), right (to 6,10), up (to 5,9), or down (to 7,9).\n2. Since reaching the exit is the primary objective, plan a path towards (row=1, col=11). The vertical distance from your current row to the exit row must be considered, and also how to navigate around the holes.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nGiven the layout, moving upwards to row=5, col=9 (ACTION_UP) seems reasonable since it keeps you on flat ground, allowing for a potential later path towards the exit without falling into any holes:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action aims to position yourself to analyze the next moves towards the exit while avoiding potential penalties from falling into holes."

Moving directly to one of the switches could assist further as it might allow the red avatar to access different paths and eliminate hazards. \n\nHowever, at (8, 15), the immediate surrounding tiles (to the left, right, up, down) reveal:\n- Left (8, 14): Free space (.)\n- Right (8, 16): Free space (.)\n- Up (7, 15): Hole (h)\n- Down (9, 15): Hole (h)\n\nMoving left or right is feasible, but moving down or up is not possible without penalties.\n\n### Action Plan\nLet's move the red avatar to the left (8, 14), which is free space and allows further strategic exploration without falling into a hole.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left should open more possibilities for actions and maintain strategic alignment with the plan to reach the exit while avoiding holes and utilizing interaction options."

However, based on the map, I will identify any potentially playable positions.\n2. **Objective**: The aim is to reach the exit (represented by '%'), which is at (1, 11).\n3. **Immediate surroundings**: The avatar's immediate area seems to be mostly empty space (represented by '.') or obstacles such as holes (represented by '&'), which should be avoided. \n\n### Analyzing the Map\nThe map has several rows where the avatar can move and potentially interact with switch mechanisms (like '@' for blue switches). The most noteworthy feature is the exit at (1, 11), just two steps up from the open area below it. The avatar is likely positioned somewhere in the rows between (2, 1) and (9, 1).\n\n### Based on the Rules:\n- **No Movement**: If moving in a particular direction doesn\u2019t change the avatar\u2019s position, I\u2019ll need to rotate it first and then move again.\n- The presence of holes and the exit must be strategically considered to avoid penalties and ensure point gain.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Since locations with walls and hazards are widespread, I would first look for an unobstructed upward path to reach the exit.\n2. Depending on the last known position of the avatar, if it is close to free space, I could attempt to move upwards in that direction.\n\n### Action Decision\nIf assuming no position has changed, then I may need to MOVE UP if I have already turned to face that direction. Potentially, I could try moving right or utilize other strategies based on the arrangements.\n\nGiven that the previous turns might have been ineffective, I will utilize the upward movement unless otherwise specified:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis upward action should direct the avatar towards the exit, effectively progressing towards winning the level."

However, if I rotate and stay in the same spot due to the action, I must plan my next move to avoid staying in place.\n\nGiven the surroundings, my best immediate action is to continue to remain on the `b` switch while assessing the next strategic moves I might take. Initially, I will perform a clockwise rotation (right), since it allows me to evaluate further.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\n\nThis action will check if I can face right, allowing me to plan my next move effectively based on what's available after executing the rotation."
