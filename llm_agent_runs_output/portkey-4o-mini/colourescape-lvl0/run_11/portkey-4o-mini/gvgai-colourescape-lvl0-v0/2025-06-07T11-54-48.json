Therefore:\n1. **Activate Switches**: Engaging the switches will change the avatar and potentially allow it to interact with the boxes.\n2. **Plan the Path**: If not currently moved, subsequent actions need to consider safe movements toward the exit.\n\nGiven that the avatar needs to change positions using a switch and potentially interact with adjacent boxes, starting with the closest switch is advisable.\n\n### Action Selection:\nSince I cannot identify the exact current position of the avatar from the provided information, I will choose to attempt to interact with the nearby blue switch located at (2, 2) to observe any changes:\n\n``` \nAction: 0 \n```\nThis action does not correspond to any specific movement but serves to gather feedback on the avatar's capabilities in the current scenario.

The avatar is currently on a path without immediate threats, but to effectively progress, we should look for switches and blocks that might aid in navigating towards the exit.\n\n### Possible Actions\nGiven the current position, we will consider moving horizontally first since the above tile is a hole (leading to a loss), and it would not be wise to attempt moving upwards. The potential moves are:\n- **Left (6, 5)**: empty space (valid move)\n- **Right (6, 7)**: empty space (valid move)\n\n### Chosen Action\nTo advance in a meaningful direction towards reaching the exit eventually, moving right seems most effective, as it keeps options open to explore adjacent spaces next and doesn't require any resets with switches.\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\n### Feedback on the Action\nExpecting to move right into an empty space will allow further maneuvering options in subsequent turns.
