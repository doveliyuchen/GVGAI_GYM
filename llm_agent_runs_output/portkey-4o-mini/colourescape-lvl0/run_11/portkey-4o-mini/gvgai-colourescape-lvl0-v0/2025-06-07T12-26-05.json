As the avatar is currently on a blue switch, it is essential to assess if moving up (row = 1) leads closer to the exit or strategic interaction while avoiding hazards.\n2. The exit is still several moves away, so a good option is to move up the blue switch and observe if this opens pathways or leads into more beneficial sprite interactions next.\n\nGiven this analysis, I'll proceed with the action to move the avatar upwards. \n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action aims to move up to (1, 2), where the avatar will remain on the floor, potentially allowing further actions or exploring new options to reach the exit."

Identify the nearest path to the exit, avoiding holes.\n2. Check for switches that need to be engaged.\n\nTo take my first action considering those points and assuming I\u2019m starting where I can potentially be (navigating from the second row):\n- I can safely move down from row 1 to row 2 to explore or interact with more elements since I see possible movement paths.\n\nI will take the first action downwards. \n\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\n\nThis action aims to advance towards the open paths available and explore further towards the exit, adhering to the strategic focus of navigating to the exit efficiently while managing interactions along the way."

However:\n- The immediate nearest path to the exit involves clear traversal from rows with available spaces. The player should aim to move down toward row `1` and then left or right from there to reach the exit.\n- The next actionable step is to **move down to row `2` (to `(2,1)`)** and begin moving towards row `1`.\n\n### Next Action\nGiven the defined movement mechanics and the current position:\n``` \nAction: 3 \n```\nThis means I choose to move **down** towards the row where paths are clearer to navigate ahead toward the exit. The expectation is to align with the strategy, exploring openings available while avoiding potential hazards ahead."

Since standing at row 2, col 2 allows me to access the blue switch ('@') at (2, 2), changing my avatar type could create way for moving the platforms vertically upwards, or towards the exit. \n\nThus, it seems wise to activate the blue switch for the next move in an effort to explore new possible actions.\n\nI will take the following action:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action aims to move right towards the blue switch, which will change my avatar to the blue avatar, allowing for further exploration and possible progression towards the exit."

The goal is to navigate to (1, 11) where the exit is.\n2. The starting point for the movement isn't explicitly given, so I'll assume we need to explore the immediate surroundings.\n3.
