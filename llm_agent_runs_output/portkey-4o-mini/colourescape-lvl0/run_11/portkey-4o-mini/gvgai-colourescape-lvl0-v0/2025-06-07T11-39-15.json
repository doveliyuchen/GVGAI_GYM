The exit is directly beneath my potential reach based on the box layout. \n\nGiven that I need to apply a meaningful action and considering I may start off near the switch at (2, 2), I will start with the action to transform by moving to the blue switch nearby.\n\nThus, my action will be:\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n\nThis action is to move down assuming I am currently on row 2 at column 2 to better access and interact with the blue switch below.

Considering the oversight of positioning where I will have to simulate an action based on the assumed avatar state.\n\nNow, reviewing available collective paths leads me to choose a travel direction distinct from my last assumed action.\n\n### Action Decision\n- I need to interact at the {2, 2} position currently housing the blue switch '@'. It will enable accessing blue avatar abilities for the next right moves, facilitating further maneuvers toward the exit column.\n\nThus, I will execute action 2, moving toward the right.\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nThis action strategically positions me to engage the blue switch and allows leveraging blue avatar features in upcoming sequences, aiding in approaching the exit successfully."
