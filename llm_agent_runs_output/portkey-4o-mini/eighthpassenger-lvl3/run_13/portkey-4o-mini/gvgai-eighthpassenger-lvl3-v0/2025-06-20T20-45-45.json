There is a pursuer directly below at (8, 5), indicating a need to be cautious while navigating.\n\nThe player must avoid pursuers and find a way to the exit located at (1, 1). Given that there are moving enemies nearby, a prudent action must be decided to move safely within the maze. \n\nLet's take the following considerations into account:\n\n1. **Current Positions**:\n   - (9, 1) - Standing\n   - (9, 2) - Standing\n   - Enemies around in the vicinity (E.g., a pursuer is at (8, 5), which could mean it might close in soon).\n\n2. **Strategy**: \n   - We must use crouching to increase stealth and avoid detection. However, due to the positions of the enemies, immediate movement must prioritize distance and movement toward the exit while being aware of switching states if needed.\n\n3. **Decision**: \n   - To begin, I will move **downwards** towards (10, 1). This position is empty and away from the pursuer\u2019s path, allowing for strategic positioning while maintaining a safe distance.\n\nThus, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action is expected to position the avatar safely in the next move while observing enemy patterns effectively."
