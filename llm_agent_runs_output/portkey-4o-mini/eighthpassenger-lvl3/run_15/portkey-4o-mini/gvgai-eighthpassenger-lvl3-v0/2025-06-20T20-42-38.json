There\u2019s a pursuer at (5, 13), which I must avoid while planning the movements.\n\n### Direction Options\nLooking at the movements:\n- Up (to (11, 12)) leads to an empty space ('.').\n- Down (to (13, 12)) also leads to an empty (though potentially safe) space.\n- Left (to (12, 11)) lands on a space ('e'), which is a wall.\n- Right (to (12, 13)) stays in the current row, but that's where the pursuer is located.\n\n### Optimal Next Move\nTo make a significant movement toward the exit while keeping the score positive and avoiding the pursuer, the best options are Up or Down, given that Left is a wall and Right attracts the pursuer.\n\nChoosing to move Up seems more strategic to get nearer to potential escape routes while keeping out of immediate danger from the pursuer.\n\nThus, I will execute the move:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\n\nMoving Up should keep me safe from direct confrontation with the pursuer while allowing further navigation towards the exit."

However, moving left (to (11, 11) and (11, 12)) or down (to (12, 12) and (12, 13)) could create more favorable escape routes.\n\nI will choose to move down as it provides a generally safe area of movement influenced by possible further escape paths while also potentially avoiding the pursuer.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nFeedback: Moving down creates more advantageous positioning by exploring potential pathways towards the exit while maintaining distance from the pursuer.
