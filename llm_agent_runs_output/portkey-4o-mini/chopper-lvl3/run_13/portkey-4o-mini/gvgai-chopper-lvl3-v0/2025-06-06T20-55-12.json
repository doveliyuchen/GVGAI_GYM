They are currently not in close proximity to the avatar.\n   - The next potential goals are to either collect supplies or reposition to a safer or more advantageous spot.\n\nGiven that our immediate goal should be to maintain the avatar and collect supplies, I will move the avatar up towards (row=7, col=4), where a supply item (h) is located.\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nThis action should help in replenishing resources and keeping the avatar safe while positioning for a future attack on the tank and portalBase."

Additionally, there is a portalBase ('*') at (11, 0) that needs to be destroyed.\n\nGiven that I must maintain the avatar's safety by destroying the nearby threats while also collecting resources, my next action should be to either move closer to targets while avoiding enemies or collect supplies that may be necessary in later encounters. \n\nSince I have not moved yet and I'm currently positioned in a pretty safe area, I will take action by moving my avatar one space to the right to position myself better.
