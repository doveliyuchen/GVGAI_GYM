Collecting resources is essential, particularly ammunition.\n2. I need to avoid potential threats or enemies while navigating toward supplies.\n\nSince I am currently positioned at (7, 4) and can move directly south to (7, 5), where an enemy is located, I will need to assess the potential threat first. Moving directly to this position might be risky.\n\nGiven that nothing has changed in my position from the last state, my next logical action would be to move upwards or sideways to get a better strategic position and collect more resources.\n\nI will move DOWN to collect supplies at (row=7, col=10).\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis move aims to gather supplies while keeping my avatar away from the immediate threat posed by the enemy to the left. I expect to collect these supplies without putting the avatar in danger."
