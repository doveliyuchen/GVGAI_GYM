    "content": "Given the current state of the game, our avatar (denoted as 'a') is located at (7, 15) in the grid. The current surrounding elements include:\n\n- Butterflies ('@') located at (7, 17), (7, 18), (8, 17), and (8, 18).\n- A cocoon ('#') at (8, 25).\n- Walls ('$') surrounding the outer section of the grid.\n\nThe immediate objective is to collect points by interacting with the butterflies while avoiding or managing the cocoons, as they can generate new butterflies. The avatar's current options for movement consist of four directions - up, down, left, and right. \n\nBased on the strategy provided:\n\n1. The avatar should prioritize defeating butterflies and should aim to either move toward them without getting trapped or causing more cocoons to spawn.\n2. In this state, the most pressing action would be for the avatar to move closer to the butterflies at (7, 17) and (7, 18). \n\nGiven this information, I will move the avatar to the right (to (7, 16)), as it is an open space next to butterflies:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action should allow the avatar to prepare for the next move toward collecting butterflies while remaining vigilant about the cocoon situation."
