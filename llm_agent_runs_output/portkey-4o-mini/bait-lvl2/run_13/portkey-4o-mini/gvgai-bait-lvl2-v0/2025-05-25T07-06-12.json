The avatar is represented as 'a' in the game state, but its position is not indicated in the current map layout. Hence, we need to deduce the avatar's position based on the absence of 'a'.\n\nFrom the map layout, we can analyze the positions of the key, goal, holes, mushrooms, and the other elements surrounding them. The following are key observations:\n\n- The goal ('#') is located at (8, 7).\n- There are various holes ('$') that can pose hazards.\n- The key ('%') is situated at (2, 6).\n- There are mushrooms ('&') at (4, 6) which can impact score.\n\nGiven the overall strategy to reach the goal while avoiding hazards, I need to decide on an action based on potential avatar movements.\n\nSince I do not know the current position of the avatar (indicated by 'a'), one recommendation to maximize the chances of success would be to first test a move that allows exploration without danger. \n\nAnalyzing possible actions:\n\n1. **ACTION_LEFT (1)**: would move left on the current row but could lead to walls (b) or holes.\n2. **ACTION_RIGHT (2)**: could potentially move towards more floors or the goal itself.\n3. **ACTION_DOWN (3)**: could lead to holes or areas with mushrooms.\n4. **ACTION_UP (4)**: could lead to walls or reduce movement options.\n\nA good initial action to maximize exploration while minimizing risk would be to **move right (ACTION_RIGHT)**, as this could lead toward the goal or environments with fewer hazards.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action allows exploration towards the goal while maintaining a safe distance from hazards. The expectation is to enhance the avatar's discovery towards the goal, depending on laws the avatar position aligns with exploration rules."

The avatar should aim to collect the key (`%`) at `(2, 6)` and then navigate toward the goal (`#`) at `(8, 7)`.\n2.

There are walls (`b`) and other obstacles (`0`, `m`, etc.) that require careful navigation.\n\n### Plan of Action\nGiven the player-controlled avatar must collect the key at (2, 6) before accessing the goal, and since I did not see the last command or current position, I will focus on moving the avatar up to reach towards the key. If the avatar is initially at a lower row (e.g., row 6, where `@` is located), I will move up to navigate towards the key.\n\n#### Chosen Action\nSince the map indicates the walls are vertically oriented, moving up appears to be the most viable next step.\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n\nThis action should help the avatar move toward the key and avoid potential hazards, aligning with the strategy of planning a route towards collecting the key first."

The game mechanics suggest that the player needs to reach the goal (marked as '#') while avoiding hazards like holes (marked as '$').\n\n### Key Items in the Environment:\n- **Key ('%')** is located at (row: 2, col: 6).\n- **Goal ('#')** is located at (row: 8, col: 7).\n- **Hazards (holes '$')** are spread throughout the map, especially in rows 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.\n\n### Observations:\n1.

The path to the goal is blocked by walls ('b'), and there are various hazards nearby.\n3. Collecting the key is essential before reaching the goal, since one cannot access the goal without it.\n\n### Proposed Strategy:\n- If the avatar starts at one of the spaces on row 6 that are clear moving left or right should move it towards positions where it can access the key or navigate down towards row 8 where the goal is located.\n\n### Available Actions:\n- As we have no current position, the most prudent action is to explore movement towards positions where key items are located while being cautious of immediate dangers.\n  \nHowever, without any position for the avatar, a concrete action cannot be defined in the current situation. Based on the rules and possible strategies, I could initiate a lateral movement to explore available paths.\n\nAssuming to start exploring from a hypothetical position in column 6 in row 6, I could move either direction.

There are multiple hazards in the form of holes ('$') and mushrooms('&') that can negatively impact my score or eliminate my avatar.\n\n### Analyzing Possible Immediate Actions\n- **From the layout**:\n   - If my avatar is on a path where I can move towards the right (towards the wall), the intention will likely be to reach towards the key at (2, 6).\n   - However, if the avatar's movement is blocked, I may need to explore routes that lead to the collection of the key while avoiding hazards.\n\n### Next Steps\nSince my avatar position was not defined at the start, we assume the player is focusing on collecting the key first. The row above squares (indices of 1, 2) might assist in movement toward the key, noting also the holes that might be blocking paths.\n\nBased on the current state and the requirement to collect the key first, I am choosing to move **RIGHT**.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action aims to navigate closer to the key while continuing to assess the layout for further movement opportunities. I expect this to be consistent with the strategy of collecting the key first on a clear path away from hazards."

The avatar occupies an unspecified position, likely somewhere in the grid (assumed at (2, 6) since the progress to obtain the key needs to happen first).\n2.

Therefore, seeking to collect a key (located at Row 2, Column 6 with the `%` symbol) is essential.\n\n### Final Decision\nWith the absence of the avatar's exact position, I suggest taking a cautious approach where further directional actions are performed assuming the avatar is positioned near the goal:\n\n1.

The aim is to collect the key while avoiding any hazards (particularly holes and the mushroom) that can lead to losing the game.\n\n### Strategy Recap\n1. **Route Planning**: We are focused on moving toward the key position at (2, 6).\n2. **Hazard Awareness**: Avoiding any holes ($) that are found in the vicinity is crucial.\n3. **Efficient Movement**: Choosing actions that will move us closer to the key without risk of being trapped or falling into hazards.\n\n### Proposed Action\nSince there hasn't been a specific movement defined, based on the current known environment and the need to get the key, the first step would logically be to try to navigate horizontally or vertically towards the key. Given the provided layout, the most straightforward action towards (2, 6) might involve moving downward or laterally through a safe route.\n\nI will initiate the action to move right toward either the key or a relevant safe space assuming the avatar is currently blocked by walls to the left, based on the game mechanics.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThe expectation from this action is to advance towards the key and establish positioning to collect it soon while maneuvering around any potential hazards."

However, there\u2019s a key ('%') at (2, 6) that may also need to be collected en route to the goal.\n\nConsidering the previous actions and following the strategy set previously, we should focus on moving downward from the current location.
