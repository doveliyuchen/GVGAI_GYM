The current state around the avatar does not show where it is specifically positioned on the 10x13 grid, but according to the mechanics, it should be actively avoiding hazards (like holes and mushrooms) and heading toward the goal (`#`) while aiming to collect keys (`%`).\n\n### Current Observations:\n1. The avatar is currently denoted `*` indicating it is in the nokey state.\n2. The direct path toward the key (`%`) and the goal (`#`) is crucial.\n3. There are walls surrounding the playable space (`b`) limiting movement.\n4. Movement is critical especially to avoid holes (`$`) and mushrooms (`&`) which could lead to a loss of life.\n\n### Proposed Action:\nThe avatar needs to move downwards to explore more of the area, potentially reaching or interacting with the key or navigating towards the goal.\n\nHowever, since we do not have the current coordinates of the avatar based on the state provided, and given that we cannot move into walls, a simple downward action should be executed to reposition and explore further, even if it doesn't immediately translate into progress.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action is to proceed downward which keeps us within the boundary of exploration and helps in assessing the next move toward acquiring the key or reaching the goal.

(floor)\n  - (6, 7): . (floor)\n\nThe goal to reach is positioned at (7, 7), which might be the end target once we collect the key (currently at (2, 6)).\n\n#### Next Steps:\n1. **Action Analysis**:\n    - **Move Down (ACTION_DOWN)** to (7, 6): The position will still be a floor tile and also allows access to the goal (7, 7) eventually.\n    - **Move Left (ACTION_LEFT)** to (6, 5): No immediate benefit, as it is just another floor tile.\n    - **Move Right (ACTION_RIGHT)** to (6, 7): Similar to moving down; it leads to another floor tile, but does not contribute towards reaching the goal.\n\n2. **Strategic Consideration**:\n   - Our priority is to collect the key, and then access the goal. Downwards movement towards (7, 6) will open access to (7, 7) goal sprite on the next move.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the best immediate action is to move downwards.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action sets us closer to the goal, allowing us to shift towards (7, 7) in the subsequent move."

This often gets highlighted in the gaming mechanic.\n\n2. **Goals and Obstacles**:\n   - The key ('%') is located at (2, 6).\n   - The goal ('#') is located at (8, 7).\n   - Various boxes ('@') are present, along with hazards like holes ('$') and mushrooms('&').\n\n3. **Possible Action Directions**:\n   - Up (to row -1)\n   - Down (to row +1)\n   - Left (to col -1)\n   - Right (to col +1)\n\nBased on the general strategy previously outlined:\n- We should prioritize collecting the key to transform our avatar's state from nokey (*) to withkey (which will be necessary to access the goal).\n- The locations of obstacles and items indicate we need to maneuver around strategically to optimize our movements.\n\nTo proceed, I will assume the avatar's initial position is near the boxes or key. Given that the key at (2, 6) is accessible, I will move the avatar to the key's direction.\n\nAssuming the avatar is directly above the key at (2, 6), the logical next step would be to move **down** to collect it.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action expects the avatar to move downwards to collect the key, aligning with our strategy of focusing on key collection."

The avatar is represented by 'a', but looking through the map you provided, I don't see the character in the current layout notation. Instead, I'll map out the positions of items (like keys, boxes, goal) and walls and determine the best course of action.\n\nThe key (`%`) is located at (2,6), the goal (`#`) is at (8,7), and there are several boxes (`@`) scattered throughout the map, notably at (2,3), (2,9), (4,1), (4,10), (5,6), and (6,6). \n\nThe following are crucial observations:\n- The avatar is in the \"nokey\" state indicated by `*`. \n- To successfully reach the goal, I need to collect the key located at (2,6) first.\n- The areas around the goal have many obstacles including walls and floor types. \n\nConsidering the mechanics and that the avatar must secure the key before reaching the goal, I'll take an action that gets the avatar closer to the key. The most immediate option is to move down or left; however, the positions of the boxes will dictate that moving towards the right (2,6) is needed to get the key effectively.\n\nIn this case, the avatar would most likely be presumed at position (3,3) based on the usual movement patterns where you're trying to position the avatar to collect things. \n\nLet's take the action of moving right towards the key:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action is aimed at positioning the avatar to collect the key, which is essential for progressing towards victory. I expect to either collect the key or at least position myself for the next turn effectively."

The goal (#) is located at (row=8, col=7), which is quite far and will require careful navigation through obstacles.\n\n### Immediate Options:\n- **Nokey State**: The avatar is in a nokey state and needs to collect the key to reach the goal.\n- **Obstacles**: There are holes ($) nearby that should be avoided as they can lead to a loss of life.\n- **Interaction with Boxes**: There are several boxes (@) available that might help me maneuver through the level.\n\nGiven that the avatar is currently on a clear path and can move, I will first move the avatar upward to investigate the level more clearly since there are holes to the right. \n\nThus, the action I will take is: \n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action will move the avatar up to (row=3, col=3), allowing me to assess further interactions with the next movement.
