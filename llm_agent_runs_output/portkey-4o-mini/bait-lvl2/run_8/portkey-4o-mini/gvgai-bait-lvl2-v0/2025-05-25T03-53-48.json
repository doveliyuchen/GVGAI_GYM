Notably, there's a special exit condition when a key is collected and used to open the goal.\n\n### Potential Strategy Based on Available Items\n1. **Identify Current Position**: If the avatar is at a position where there is a box (`@`), they can push it around to navigate obstacles.\n2. **Aim for Key and Goal**: The priority should be to collect the key at (2, 6) and then proceed to (8, 7) where the goal is located.\n3. **Navigating Hazards**: Be cautious of holes in adjacent positions to avoid losing health or dying.\n\n### Choosing an Action\nSince the avatar's initial position is unclear but involves potential navigation of the layout, we should consider possible initial actions based on where the key and hazards are located. \n\nAssuming the avatar is positioned in rows that allow one movement closer to the key, a suitable first action would be a move towards collecting the key.

The relevant layout shows the position of different entities, including the avatar, key, boxes, holes, and the goal. \n\n### Current Analysis\nThe avatar is somewhere in the map, and we need to look for its coordinates. The layout shows a significant number of walls ('b'), holes ('$'), and other items such as boxes ('@'), empty spaces ('.'), mushrooms ('&'), and a goal ('#'). \n\nThe goal is located near the bottom of the map at coordinates (8, 7), but the avatar's current position is not provided in the description, making it crucial to locate it in the provided layout. We also see that the key ('%') is located at (2, 6), which needs to be collected to open the goal.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Finding the Avatar's Position**: \n   - The avatar's actual position in the layout needs to be determined first. It could be in one of the rows where you see a path without walls.\n   - The rows must be scanned for the character 'a' representing the avatar.\n   \n2. **Determine Possible Actions**:\n   - Depending on the location of the avatar, it might be necessary to move to collect the key or avoid holes.\n   - If the avatar is in a section with boxes ('@'), strategizing how to use them will be important for navigating towards the key and then the goal.\n\n3. **Choosing Action**: \n   - Select a direction that either allows immediate movement towards the key or towards safety if the avatar is facing potential kill conditions.\n\nWithout seeing the avatar's exact coordinates in the previous state, I will only compose a general action. However, if the avatar is in the vicinity of walls or near holes, the focus will be to navigate safely first and then to the key.\n\n### Making a Move\nSince I need additional data to finalize the action, I will assume the avatar is currently at an open position. I select an action towards any potential items based on the established strategies.\n\nI'll assume the next logical move could be to the right (if the avatar is positioned at a position where it can navigate towards the goal).\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action moves the avatar to the right, and I expect to observe whether it leads towards collecting the key or progresses towards the goal."

Moving down towards row 6 appears promising as it offers space without immediate hazards. \n\nThus, the action will be to:\n\n``` \nAction:3\n```\nI am choosing to move down, as it offers an opportunity to explore further space while checking for safe paths towards either the key or the goal."

The logical next step is to assess where the avatar currently is, along with the objectives that need to be met, specifically reaching the goal (`#`) and collecting the key (`%`) while avoiding pitfalls such as holes (`$`) and mushrooms (`&`).\n\nGiven the layout, the goal (`#`) is located at row 8, column 7 and the key (`%`) is at row 2, column 6. Nearby, there are holes at various positions and boxes (`@`) that will play a role in navigation.\n\n### Current Observations:\n- The goal (`#`) is accessible but requires careful movement since it's positioned safely, and the avatar must avoid interactions that can lead to being killed.\n- The avatar needs to get to the key first, which is crucial for winning.\n\nLet's now identify the current position of the avatar based on the last recorded map state. The series of rows indicates that the avatar remains immobile and needs direction.\n\nAssuming the avatar is already positioned at row 6, column 6, the first move should be towards the key. The only viable action from row 6, column 6 to row 5, column 6 is **ACTION_UP**.\n\nThus, I will proceed with the following action:\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nBy moving up, I expect the avatar to start heading toward the key, avoiding any surrounding dangers if they exist. This aligns with our strategy of collecting the key first to reach the goal safely."

Assuming the current starting position of my avatar is not specified here, I need to analyze based on logical movements.\n\nGiven I want to explore and understand key items:\n- If the avatar is not currently adjacent, I'd move toward the key.\n  \nAs I don't have the initial avatar position specified:\n- Assuming the current position is relatively safe (like a row where no holes or mushrooms are present), I will attempt to go `ACTION_RIGHT` as a basic exploratory move. \n\nThus, I will proceed with:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\n  \n### Feedback:\nThis action is aimed at understanding the positioning of the avatar in relation to the key and ensuring safety from dangers while moving. I expect this will bring me closer to my intended collection of the key next."
