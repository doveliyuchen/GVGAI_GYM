The avatar needs to collect a key located at `(2,6)` (represented by `%`) to transform before accessing the goal at `(8,7)` (represented by `#`).\n2. There are obstacles and walls surrounding various routes. The most significant threats are the holes which can lead to the avatar's death.\n3. The goal must be accessed using the key-carried avatar state, hence collecting that key is critical to achieving victory.\n\n### Strategy Going Forward:\nTo maximize progress towards the goals:\n- **Move Toward the Key**: To collect the key, the priority should be reaching `(2,6)`. From the provided layout, the available free spaces around obstacles and walls should be calculated.\n\n### Possible Move:\nAssuming the avatar is positioned at `(6,6)` based on the most open area in proximity to the key, moving **UP** (to `(5,6)`) or **LEFT** would be beneficial to clear the path.\n\nGiven that potential rotations could be necessary before the avatar moves, I will choose:\n\n``` \nAction:4 \n```\n\n### Feedback:\nI am choosing to move UP to `(5,6)` to get closer to the key while avoiding any obstacles or holes. My expectation is to change the position of the avatar and better position myself to collect the key in the next move."

Holes are deadly and are located primarily in the row range from 1 to 4.\n\n### Objective Recap\nOur aim is to find and collect keys, then use them to reach the goal while avoiding obstacles and holes. \n\n### Strategic Approach\n1. **Locate the Avatar**: Since the avatar's position isn't specified, it would likely be in an open area available for movement away from walls or holes. The effective risk is avoiding moving towards holes.\n2. **Collect the Key**: Moving towards the key at (2, 6) should be the first step unless otherwise obstructed (which needs confirmation based on the avatar's specific position).\n3. **Avoid Holes**: Ensure that the movement strategy does not navigate towards any holes during the exploration.\n4. **Plan the Next Move Towards the Goal**: After collecting the key and transforming, redirect actions towards reaching the goal.\n\n### Direction for First Move\nIf the avatar is in any position that allows a path to the key without falling into holes, the action to move upwards seems logical to gather the key first. However, in case of walls or obstructions, to act accordingly with the strategy, I will assume an initial left, right, down, or up movement keeps those risks in mind. \n\nGiven that there are no obstacles explicitly stated for an upward move towards the key:\n\n```Action:4```\n\nThis action implies moving up to explore and potentially collect the key, which aligns with the strategy of gathering resources first."

The immediate surroundings of the avatar are:\n   - On row 6, col 6: the avatar is on a box (`@`).\n   - Nearby, in adjacent positions:\n     - Row 5, col 6: box (`@`), which we can interact with.\n     - Row 7, col 6: empty floor (`.`).\n     - Row 6, col 5: empty floor (`.`).\n     - Row 6, col 7: empty floor (`.`).\n\n2.

The downward direction (row 1, col 0) is also a wall ('b').\n2. **Vertical Possibilities**: The only movement left is right (which should result in moving right into 'b' as well), hence a strategy is needed to rotate direction and approach further options.\n\nGiven the current context that the avatar remains against the wall with no options to effectively navigate or explore, the best action is to choose a directional action that effectively allows me to rotate and potentially explore different routes.\n\n### Decision Making:\n- The first necessary action is to rotate since there's no effective movement happening.

However, it is not specified in the game state provided directly. Therefore, I will analyze the state to see possible actions.\n\n### Current Map Analysis:\n- The avatar is likely positioned at a location where it can see surrounding tiles, including possible interactions with keys, goals, obstacles, etc.\n- There are goal sprites (`#`) at the position (8, 7) and there is also a key (`%`) at (2, 6).\n- The nearby obstacles need to be avoided, and walls prevent movements in many directions.\n\nSince I do not see the avatar explicitly mentioned, I will assume I can choose any initial move from a position that seems most advantageous based on the keys and goals available.\n\n### Strategy Application:\nSince keys are necessary to transform the avatar:\n- I will first attempt to navigate towards the key at (2, 6).\n  \n### Navigating Towards Key:\n- Based on visualizing the map, I can approach the key directly from my next action without obstacles.\n\nAssuming the avatar is at a position near (2, 5), a right action leads to (2, 6), where the key is located.\n\nTherefore, I will proceed with the action to the right:\n\n```Action:2```\n\nThis action is expected to bring me closer to the key, helping achieve the objective of collecting necessary items for completing the level."

Based on the surrounding environment, obstacles (walls, holes, boxes, mushrooms), and key items (keys, goals), I need to choose an action that would best help in navigating towards the goal.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s analyze where the avatar's next viable action should lead:\n- **Goals**: There's a goal at (8, 7) but it requires the avatar to be in a transformed state after collecting a key at (2, 6).\n- **Holes**: There are dangerous holes present at (1, 4), (1, 5), and similar along various rows which could lead to avatar death if approached.\n- **Boxes**: There are plenty of boxes present, particularly at (2, 3), (2, 9), and others in multiple rows that can assist in navigation if positioned appropriately.\n- **Mushrooms**: There's a mushroom at (4, 6) which should be avoided due to point penalties.\n\nConsidering the strategic factors involved, I will focus on the nearest key and attempt to move towards it, avoiding immediate obstacles. Since I currently don't have the exact location of the avatar, my best option is to prepare for potential movement towards collecting the nearest key:\n\nAssuming the avatar starts in an open area where movement is possible, I will first attempt to move to the right until I've collected the key if not already.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action aims to advance towards a collectible key, which is an essential step towards achieving the win condition. If movement is successful, I expect to move towards retrieving the key and transforming my avatar, thereby unlocking access to the goals."

If I assume the avatar is currently at (7, 1) based on the map layout, I need to determine possible movements considering obstacles and items.\n\n3. **Movable Directions**:\n   - Available directions from the assumed avatar position (7, 1) would be:\n     - Left to (7, 0): blocked (wall)\n     - Right to (7, 2): clear (empty)\n     - Up to (6, 1): clear (empty)\n     - Down to (8, 1): clear (empty)\n\nWith these conditions, the most advantageous action is to move to the right (7, 2) since it allows further explorations towards collecting the key.\n\n### Deciding Action:\nBased on the exploration principle, the action that best fulfills the next step of gathering useful items without immediate threats is to move right.\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\nThis action should position us closer to exploring the level's layout further while keeping strategic movement in mind. I expect the avatar\u2019s position to change, allowing access to new areas on subsequent moves."

Here are the key elements:\n\n- The avatar is currently at an unspecified position (you'll need to provide that detail). \n- Key locations are at (2, 6), (4, 6), and (6, 6) representing the key sprite ('%').\n- One goal is located at (8, 7) representing the goal sprite ('#').\n- There are several holes ('$') and obstacles ('.', 'b') throughout the level that may impede movement.\n\n### Strategy:\nGiven that the main objective is to eliminate goal sprites while avoiding hazards, the strategy will focus on moving towards the keys to transform the avatar and then heading towards the goal.\n\nIf the avatar is positioned on the key floor (such as (2, 6)), the next logical step would be to collect that key first. \n\nI'll assume the avatar needs to move right or down toward collecting keys or reaching the goal based on the position.\n\nSince I don\u2019t have the exact position of the avatar, I'll initiate an action based on moving towards an area that seems strategically beneficial:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThe expected action is to move to the right since it will bring the avatar closer to potential keys and avoid immediate hazards.
