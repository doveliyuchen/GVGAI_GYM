The goal is to collect the key, which is significantly higher on the map at `(2, 6)`.\n2.

Since the position of the avatar does not change from previous analysis, I need to make a move towards collecting the key, avoiding the obstacles as effectively as possible.\n\n#### Interpretation and Next Move:\n1. The key is located at (2, 6), and based on typical puzzle layouts, the initial move should either involve navigating toward the key or approaching it strategically.\n2. The position should be analyzed thoroughly if there are walls or hazards that would conflict with movement.\n3. The best next feasible move to navigate towards the key should be made because going towards the key is paramount at this moment.\n\n**Assuming the avatar can move to the right (if the avatar currently isn't blocked), I will select that movement option first:**\n\n``` \nAction:2 \n```\nFeedback: I expect this action to bring the avatar closer to the key at (2, 6) while avoiding any hazards since the direction is open, facilitating progress towards the win condition."

The next actions should focus on effectively getting to the key while avoiding hazards.\n\n### Proposed Action\nGiven the layout and information:\n- If the avatar is positioned anywhere above row 8, moving down (ACTION_DOWN) might be constructive towards reaching the next row which could offer access to the key or a clearer path.\n\nHowever, without re-confirming my exact position, I will suggest the action that optimally directs me toward the key while ensuring my current position adjustments.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action aims to move down toward a lower row that could potentially present either access paths to the goal or closer to the key.

The implied position needs to be inferred based on coordinates used for the `avatar` sprite in typical game layouts.\n- Key (`%`) is at position (2,6) and a goal (`#`) is at (8,7). \n- There are multiple boxes (`@`) scattered across various positions, which can potentially be used for navigation.\n- The map borders are mostly walls (`b`), creating a confined space for navigation.\n- Hazards such as holes (`$`) are present, making careful navigation necessary.\n\n### Strategy\nGiven the need to progress towards the goal:\n1.

Any other status should lead me to explore options concerning nearby obstacles and their relative positioning to the goal.\n\nGiven the information and provided game mechanics, here's an actionable next step, presuming my avatar starts in a relevant position to either approach the key or navigate through the available path:\n\n1. **Action:** Move towards collecting the key.\n2. **Feedback:** If at or near the key position, I will collect it and prepare for the next step towards unlocking the door.\n\nSince I lack the explicit position of my avatar, I will make a general move toward the direction of the key for this turn. If the avatar position happens to be at a reasonable distance and contextually makes sense, I deduce it as follows:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis means moving right towards the key if the avatar was on the left side and might not have been directly at the key before observing the map.

However, there is no 'a' listed in the current map; hence, the player character is not present on the board in this state.\n\n2. **Key Position:** The key ('%') is located at (2, 6).\n\n3. **Goal Position:** The goal ('#') is at (8, 7).\n\n4. **Obstacles:** Notable hazards include holes ('$') on various tiles, mushrooms ('&'), and walls ('b'). \n\n5. **Interactable Items:** There are boxes ('@') that may be moved around the map to navigate or create pathways.\n\n### Strategic Movement\nSince the avatar is currently not represented, I assume it might be a misinterpretation or a state condition indicating that the avatar is in the process of action but hasn't been validated. \n\nGiven the scenario where a move needs to be made right away to reach the key:\n\n1. **To Collect the Key:** Move towards the key in order to transition into the \"withkey\" state.\n\n2. **Next Steps:** After acquiring the key, I would then aim to reach the goal.\n\n### Decision Making\nHowever, the current state seems stagnant without the avatar. Therefore, I can't execute any movements without a clear understanding of the avatar's previous position or if it's temporarily inactive.\n\nTo take action given this situation, I must:\n- Verify the current action state or determine if the action can change (i.e., I might need to act as if the avatar can begin movement).\n\nGiven that I need the avatar to start and head towards its goal, I shall proceed with the assumption of 'down' as a direction to potentially transition from a start state or to initiate activity (moving toward where the key is located or resetting the action). \n\n### Action\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThe reasoning here is for potential re-activation or to simulate the start if not already active. If the avatar is still represented, there will be an opportunity to adjust or analyze further."

The avatar must navigate to the key to transition into the \"withkey\" state.\n2. The avatar's potential movement is limited by walls and hazards, making careful planning necessary to avoid death and to eventually reach the goal.\n\n### Strategy Execution\nThe next move should be focused on getting closer to the key. The avatar currently does not have the position specified, so we start by moving towards the key's location.\n\nGiven that the previous position is unknown, I will attempt to perform a movement action that would typically move towards the key directly:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action means moving RIGHT from the current position in the expectation of approaching the key.

Avoid hazards, notably holes ('$') and mushrooms('&'), evident throughout the map.\n\nGiven your feedback of needing to assess the avatar's position while also ensuring the action taken reflects the strategic plan, let's find the first optimal action.\n\nInitially, the avatar can interact with the boxes to potentially reach (2,6) or navigate around dangers. Since we do not have the exact position of the avatar, but we can see there are boxes beneath the key, a potential move could be to get closer to the key first.\n\n### Action Decision:\nIf we assume the avatar is near a box (since we observe it at (2,3)), moving it to the right might provide access to interact with the key:\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis first movement to the right (towards (2,4) and then ultimately (2,6) for the key) is crucial to progress forward while staying safe from immediate hazards and maintaining a strategic approach. The expectation based on this action is to approach the key more directly, enabling collection on the subsequent turn."
