The avatar must avoid these to prevent a loss.\n\n3. **Nearby Boxes**: Boxes (`@`) are present at `(2, 3)`, `(2, 9)`, `(4, 2)`, `(4, 10)`, `(5, 6)`, and `(6, 6)`. These can be bounced upon to increase the avatar's movement and avoid hazards.\n\n### Context of the Game:\n- Reaching the key is essential. Once the avatar collects the key, they can interact with the goal. The tiles marked with holes should be approached with caution, ensuring movement does not lead to falling into them.\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Prioritize Collecting the Key**: The immediate strategy should focus on reaching the location of the key since the objective is to collect it first before heading towards the goal.\n- **Use Available Boxes for Navigation**: Identify how boxes can be utilized for moving through the level without falling into hazards.\n\n### Action Determination\nSince the exact avatar position isn't provided, I will assume a scenario to initiate a meaningful move towards the key's location. The avatar effectively needs to navigate toward `(2, 6)` where the key is located.\n\n**Assuming the Avatar is Positioned to the Left of Key:**\n- Move **right** toward the key since it's located at `(2, 6)` and adjacent to available space.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \nThis action should help the avatar move closer to the key and is crucial for progression in the game strategy by allowing the collection of the key. The expectation is to see the avatar successfully approach the key without falling into any hazards."

Avoiding hazards like holes and mushrooms.\n2. Collecting the key first to access the goal.\n3. Bouncing off boxes when necessary for movement.\n\n### Proposed Action\nGiven the defined rules and understanding the strategy:\n1.

The 'a' indicates the avatar, which is not currently visible in the text representation. Therefore, we will presume it exists among the '@' symbols representing boxes/or potential locations. \n\n### Observations:\n- The goal (represented by '#') is located at (8, 7). \n- The key (represented by '%') is located at (2, 6).\n- There are various obstacles including walls ('b'), holes ('$'), and mushrooms ('&').\n- The avatar can interact with boxes ('@') which are located at multiple positions across the map.\n\n### Analyzing Potential Moves:\n1. If the avatar is currently located near the bottom near the boxes (for example at (5, 6) or (6, 6)), moving down could provide access to other boxes.\n2. The key is located at (2, 6). Therefore, some strategy needs to be devised to reach the key to transform the avatar.\n3.

If the avatar isn't moving towards the key or goal and impacted by walls, it might need to adjust its path towards them.\n\n### Keys to Recall:\n- The box can bounce the avatar which can be used strategically.\n- The hole will result in a game over if the avatar falls into one.\n  \n### Decision:\nLet\u2019s assume the avatar is positioned at (6, 6) which is one of the last tracked positions indicated by '@'. The avatar can try to move to the left (action 1) towards a box, allowing it to potentially bounce and change positions next.\n\nI'd suggest the following action:\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\n\n**Feedback:** This move is directed towards the left which will place the avatar adjacent to more boxes (if 'a' were located at (6, 6)), allowing it to use a box in subsequent moves for additional interactions while still staying clear of mushrooms and holes.

Let's locate where the '@' sprites are:\n  - The avatar appears at coordinates (2,3), (4,2), (5,6), and (6,6).\n\nFrom the mapping, the relevant sprites around these locations are:\n- (2, 3) is on a box ('@') position.\n- (4, 2) is on a box ('@') position.\n- (5, 6) is on a box ('@') position.\n- (6, 6) is on a box ('@') position.\n\nIn addition, the goal ('#') is located at (8, 7), but the avatar needs to collect a key located at (2, 6) before being able to interact with the goal.\n\n### Available Actions\nThe possible actions for the avatar are:\n0. ACTION_NIL\n1. ACTION_LEFT\n2. ACTION_RIGHT\n3. ACTION_DOWN\n4. ACTION_UP\n\n### Prioritizing Actions\nThe strategy advises to:\n1. **Collect Keys:** The avatar needs to move towards the key located at (2, 6).\n2. **Avoid Hazards:** This collection should avoid holes ('0') which can cause immediate loss.\n\n#### From (2, 3) (position of the avatar):\n- The possible movement options from here are as follows:\n   - Moving LEFT (to (2,2)) would hit a wall ('b').\n   - Moving RIGHT (to (2,4)) would hit a hole ('0').\n   - Moving DOWN (to (3,3)) is open ('.'), but it does not lead toward the key immediately.\n   - Moving UP would hit a wall ('b').\n\nLooking further based on nearby position:\n- The key is at (2, 6), which is two movement cells away to the right from my current position (2, 3).\n  \nTo move to (2, 6):\n- I will attempt to move RIGHT twice from my position at (2, 3):\n1. Move RIGHT to (2, 4) - but that's a hole (0), so it's not a viable action.\n2. Move RIGHT (2, 5) - free, but then I land on (2, 6) for the key.\n\nSince the obstacle (hole) is in my immediate right, I will need to reposition using available avenues.\n\nThe next best action is to move DOWN, which is free space (3, 3), then plan from there to navigate towards the key at (2, 6).\n\n### Conclusion \nI will perform the following action:\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\nMoving down gives me more options subsequently to maneuver towards the key."

Currently, the avatar is well-positioned with the option to either move up or left (since down leads to potential harm).\n\nGiven the avoidance of hazards and the need to explore potential paths towards the key and goal, the best immediate action would be to **move up** to row 5, column 6 where another box is located.\n\nConsidering the analysis, I will take the following action:\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n\nThis action corresponds to moving **UP**.

If the avatar is somewhere nearby and can see boxes, those can be utilized to bounce toward reachable keys or areas.\n2.

If we are currently sitting near the box at (4, 2) or (5, 6), we can consider bouncing off those to alter our position towards safer areas or collecting the key.\n\nHowever, since we don't have a specific position for your avatar, and assuming we start from a position like (6, 6) where a box is available, I would recommend the action sequence:\n\n- First, assess around position (6, 6) upwards (5, 6): if the avatar can move up, the next action should be to maximize movement towards the key.\n\nAssuming an upward movement towards collecting the key is available and strategic:\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n\nThis action aims to advance towards the key, aligning with the strategy of obtaining keys to successfully interact with the goal while avoiding hazards. Expect to either get closer to the key or find a safe position for the next move."

At first glance, some notable positions on the map are:\n\n- **Avatar Location:** The avatar ('a') can be spotted on row 5, column 6.\n- **Key Location:** The key ('%') is located at row 2, column 6.\n- **Mushroom Location:** There is a mushroom ('&') at row 4, column 6.\n- **Goal Location:** The goal ('#') is located at row 8, column 7.\n\nThe objective is to reach the goal while avoiding hazards and collecting the key.\n\n### Strategy Assessment:\n- The avatar currently has no key, so it cannot directly interact with the goal.\n- The immediate path to the key requires careful planning due to the mushroom located directly above the key (row 3, column 6).\n\n### Potential Actions:\n1. **Move Left (row 5, col 5)**: This area is clear ('.') but doesn\u2019t lead directly to the key.\n2. **Move Right (row 5, col 7)**: This area is blocked by a wall ('b').\n3. **Move Down (row 6, col 6)**: This area contains another box ('@') which is safe to land.\n4. **Move Up (row 4, col 6)**: This area contains a mushroom ('&'), which would cause the avatar to lose a life.\n\nGiven the options, moving down would allow the avatar to access another box, which can facilitate a later move either back up or to the left/right and does not lead to immediate danger.\n\n### Decision:\n``` Action: 3 ```\nMoving down puts the avatar in a safer position, away from hazards, and facilitates potential movement towards the key. I expect to assess the next possible steps without encountering immediate danger."

Since the location of the avatar isn't directly stated, I will assume it is somewhere on the level. To deduce the immediate action, I will opt for a simple movement that would not lead into a wall or hazard. \n\n2. Analyzing the strategic moves available:\n   - If the avatar is in the vicinity of the bottom rows near the key (rows 2-4), I will take a neutral action to adjust my approach.\n\nGiven this context, I will take the action to move right from the presumed current position:\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nThis action aims to explore further and potentially allow for a better path toward the key if applicable. I expect to see a shift in position towards possibly being closer to surrounding entities or the key."

The current objective after assessing the surroundings is to potentially move closer to the goal.\n\n### Actions and Strategy:\nSince the avatar is capable of bouncing off boxes, moving down (to (7, 6)) opens up further options such as exploring more of the level and potentially moving towards the goal.\n\nGiven there are no immediate hazards in the down direction and that it leads toward a more open area, I will choose to move down.\n\n### Action Decision:\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action should allow exploration to open up toward the lower part of the map, leading to potential pathways toward the goal. Keeping the strategy in mind, I expect this movement to provide more options for further positioning in subsequent turns."
