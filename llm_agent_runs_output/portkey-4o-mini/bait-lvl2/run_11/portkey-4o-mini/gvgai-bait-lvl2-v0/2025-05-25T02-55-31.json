The first task is to navigate the avatar to the key located at (2, 6).\n2. Given the vertical distance to the key, the avatar will need to move up and navigate avoiding the walls and hazards.\n3. Each upward move and then across should also consider where the box at (4, 2) can be used as it provides a diversion.\n\n### Next Move\nTo create a path toward collecting the key, I'll start with a movement directly upwards as the immediate action. \n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n\nWith this action, I will expect to see if the avatar can move up to (7, 6) while assessing the feasibility of further moves to traverse towards the key.

Therefore, moving upwards or sideways to navigate to the key should be first.\n- Vertical movement is limited by walls (`b`) on the top row and edges; thus, I have to ensure I can maneuver around the walls to reach the key effectively.\n  \nGiven that the avatar's position does not change, I need to take an action that represents an attempt to navigate toward the key. The only meaningful direction to achieve this goal, while keeping the walls in consideration, is to navigate left or right towards an area that can either approach the goal downwards or the key collected upwards.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best immediate action based on this analysis would be to move **down**.

However, the current map layout shows that there is a key located at (2, 6). Therefore, the immediate action cannot be to reach the goal, as the avatar cannot reach it yet due to the constraint of needing a key.\n\nInstead, the avatar needs to navigate towards the key, which is more than one row in the upward direction.

Up (to 6,6) - which contains a box ('@').\n2. Down (to 8,6) - which is empty ('.').\n3. Left (to 7,5) - which is a wall ('b').\n4. Right (to 7,7) - which is a wall ('b').\n\n### Strategy:\nMoving down to (8,6) is a viable option since it will provide more space for movement later.

This needs to be prioritized since we cannot access the goal directly as we are currently in the 'nokey' state.\n\n### Movement Options:\nFrom (8, 6), the potential actions are:\n- Move **Left** to (8, 5): Empty space.\n- Move **Right** to (8, 7): Move directly to the goal. (Not possible yet until key collected.)\n- Move **Down** to (9, 6): Wall.\n- Move **Up** to (7, 6): Empty space.\n\nSince we cannot yet access the goal due to the key requirement, we need to move in a direction that allows us to eventually reach the key.\n\n### Next Move Decision:\nI will choose to move **Up** to (7, 6). This action keeps us on course to make our way towards where we can later navigate for the key.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis should allow us to avoid any hazards while moving towards a more favorable position to explore paths to reach the key."
