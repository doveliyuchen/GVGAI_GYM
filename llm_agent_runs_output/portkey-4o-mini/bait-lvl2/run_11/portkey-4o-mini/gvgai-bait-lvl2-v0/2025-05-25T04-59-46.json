However, considering that the avatar is currently `nokey`, it's essential to prioritize this transformation before reaching for the goal.\n\n### Next Step:\n- To get a key, I see that the closest key (`%`) is located at (2, 6). The method to reach this key involves tactical movement through the floor without stepping onto any hazards.\n\n### Available Actions:\n1. **Move Left (ACTION_LEFT)**\n2. **Move Right (ACTION_RIGHT)**\n3. **Move Down (ACTION_DOWN)**\n4. **Move Up (ACTION_UP)**\n\nGiven the current position of the avatar, I can determine which action might best serve in the pursuit of the key to assist in reaching the goal. \n\n### Proposed Action:\nTo analyze effectively:\n- The avatar is at (8, 6).

Moving down (to (7, 6)) allows progress through the level while avoiding walls and holes.\n2. The immediate path to the key at (2, 6) is blocked and requires a more strategic approach to navigate the level and retrieve the key efficiently in future moves.\n\nThus, the first meaningful action is to move downward.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action takes the avatar down one step closer to potentially navigating towards the key in future moves.
