The goal ('%') is at row 4, column 0, and there are walls ('b') surrounding much of the grid, as well as some crates ('#'), boulders ('@'), a square hole ('*'), and enemies ('$') positioned in various spots.\n\n### Current Information:\n- **Avatar Position**: (4, 3)\n- **Goal Position**: (4, 0) - reachable in three horizontal moves to the left.\n- **Important Notes**: Direct paths to the goal are generally clear but might require dealing with crates to maximize score or work through obstacles.\n\n### Potential Actions:\n1. **ACTION_LEFT (2, 3)**: Moves the avatar to (4, 2), but that position currently has a crate ('#').\n2. **ACTION_RIGHT (4, 4)**: Moves the avatar to (4, 4), which is clear and viable.\n3. **ACTION_UP (3, 3)**: Moves the avatar up to (3, 3), which is clear and might also open routes to interact with crates/boulders.\n4. **ACTION_DOWN (5, 3)**: Moves the avatar down to (5, 3), which is also clear.\n\nGiven the game\u2019s mechanics, we should aim to move towards the goal while managing crates effectively. The safest immediate action appears to be to move left since that positions the avatar directly adjacent to the crate; however, since the avatar cannot push the crate without sufficient space, we might consider heading to an empty space to allow for subsequent maneuvering around obstacles.\n\nTo ensure progress toward the goal while avoiding getting stuck or cornered, the best immediate action would be to move left into the crate. Subsequently, it gives the opportunity to either potentially push the crate or explore smoother navigation paths towards the goal.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe next action will be to move left to (4, 2):\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis should facilitate further movement options in subsequent turns while remaining close to the goal."

(empty space)\n  - (3, 1) -> b (wall above)\n  - (2, 2) -> . (empty space up)\n  - (4, 2) -> .

    "content": "To make an informed action based on the current state of the game, let\u2019s first summarize the relevant information:\n\n**Current Avatar Position**: (2, 2)\n**Map Layout**:\n- The avatar is situated on a grid where various entities are located including walls (`b`), crates (`#`), and enemies (`$`).\n- The goal (`%`) is located at (4, 0).\n- There are hazards like boulders (`@`) around (especially at (6, 13) and (7, 12)), and the enemy ($) is located at (1, 14) and other places.\n\nBased on the strategy provided earlier, some steps should include analyzing the surrounding elements and determining the next move carefully. The avatar position hasn\u2019t changed since the last move (assuming there was a previous action that didn\u2019t affect the avatar's position). \n\nThe following options are available for action:\n\n1. **ACTION_LEFT (1)**: Would move the avatar left to (2, 1), but that space is empty.\n2. **ACTION_RIGHT (2)**: Would move the avatar right to (2, 3), also empty.\n3. **ACTION_DOWN (3)**: Would move the avatar down to (3, 2), an empty space.\n4. **ACTION_UP (4)**: Would move the avatar up to (1, 2), where there's a crate.\n\nThe most strategic option here would be to move UP into (1, 2) where a crate is located. This move could potentially set up further actions like pushing the crate once that position is occupied.\n\nHence, I will decide to take the action to move UP.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action will place the avatar at (1, 2), allowing for further interactions with the crate located there."

Analyzing the current state, the surrounding entities are as follows:\n\n- To the left (row=2, col=1) is a wall (b).\n- To the right (row=2, col=3) is an empty space (.).\n- Down (row=3, col=2) is also an empty space (.).\n- Up (row=1, col=2) has a crate (#).\n\nSince the avatar is surrounded on three sides by walls or crates, the only viable move is either moving right or down. Both directions lead to empty spaces.\n\nConsidering the strategy:\n1. **Maximize Safety**: Since we want to avoid enemies and strategize for health preservation, moving to an empty space seems prudent.\n2. **Consider Future Moves**: Moving to the right (to (row=2, col=3)) opens up more potential future moves than moving down (to (row=3, col=2)).\n\nHence, the best action for the avatar is to move right.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving right seems to align with the strategy to utilize space effectively and prepare for the next moves."

Observing the surrounding tiles, I see multiple crates (represented as '#'), a goal (represented as '%') located at (4, 0), and an enemy ('$') at (1, 14) among other objects.\n\nTaking into account the strategy outlined earlier, it is crucial to plan a path toward the goal while avoiding enemy confrontation and managing crates for scoring opportunities. Notably:\n\n- The goal at (4, 0) is two rows below, but there are walls ('b') directly ahead.\n- There are crates around which can be pushed to manipulate the environment.\n- The enemy at (1, 14) does not pose an immediate threat since it is not directly above or to the left of our avatar.\n\nNow, let's consider moving closer to the goal while also allowing for potential crate manipulation.\n\n### Deciding the Action\nI'll move 'down' to (3, 2) to create space for future moves toward breaking through to the goal area. This will allow a check on the next moves while positioning myself in a less constrained area.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis move should help open up new possibilities for pushing crates and getting closer to the goal without running into enemies or walls immediately."
