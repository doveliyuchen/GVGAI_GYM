The goal (represented by '%') is located at (row=4, col=0).\n\nTo prioritize health management and to successfully navigate towards the goal without losing health from the enemy, we need to consider our available moves while ensuring that we avoid contacting the enemy.\n\n### Possible Actions Analysis:\n1. **ACTION_LEFT (to (row=4, col=1))**: This move leads straight towards a hole ('&') but brings the avatar closer to the enemy at (row=2, col=14). This is not advisable.\n2. **ACTION_RIGHT (to (row=4, col=3))**: This move takes the avatar to an empty space ('.') but does not bring it closer to the goal and remains adjacent to crates which may be useful later. However, it does not directly avoid any threats.\n3. **ACTION_DOWN (to (row=5, col=2))**: Moves downwards into another empty space ('.') but potentially opens up further paths. This may not be the best choice as it doesn't lead towards the goal efficiently.\n4. **ACTION_UP (to (row=3, col=2))**: This would push the avatar up into (row=3, col=2), which is also empty ('.'). This creates opportunities to explore further but again may not lead towards the goal.\n\n### Strategic Decision:\nGiven the analysis, the best immediate action is to **ACTION_LEFT**. This is because it positions the avatar next to the round hole, allowing further strategic play to either score points or use the hole as leverage against the enemy in future moves. While it seems to bring the avatar closer to potential threats, it avoids immediate health loss and allows for exploration of key environmental elements.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThe action chosen moves the avatar closer to the round hole, setting up opportunities for future scoring while maintaining relative safety."

The crates at (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), and so on can serve as tools for this maneuver.\n\n### Selected Action:\nThe logical first step is to move left to maintain proximity to the goal while ensuring maneuverability to handle subsequent obstacles.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left should reposition the avatar efficiently while allowing for strategic interactions with the crates ahead.
