The strategy suggests you should focus on reaching the goal while managing your health and avoiding enemies. Your next move should be strategically directed towards moving left to approach the goal, but first, let's analyze possible movements.\n\nThe current state of the map suggests the following:\n\n- Your avatar (a) is surrounded by walls on the left (4,2) and there are no crates nearby to utilize for movement or blocking enemies.\n- Moving left (to (4, 2)) seems to be blocked by a wall.\n- The next best action is moving down or staying in place until movement through the maze is clear.\n\nConsidering your objective is to reach the goal, let's first attempt to move left, even if that position ultimately doesn't change due to the wall. However, since the action doesn't lead to movement, it will initiate a rotation.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action will confirm whether it's possible to shift left, and if not, I'll need to reassess the situation physically.
