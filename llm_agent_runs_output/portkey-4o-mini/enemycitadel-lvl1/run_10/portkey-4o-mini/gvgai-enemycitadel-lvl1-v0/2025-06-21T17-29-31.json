Finally, from (1, 2) we can move left to (1, 1) which is also a wall (b), further moves will be needed.\n\nHowever, the goal is to prioritize reaching it while avoiding enemies. A better immediate action is to move **Left**, as it keeps you heading toward the goal without confrontation, and if you meet a crate you can use it effectively next turn. \n\nThus, my chosen action is:\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nFeedback: Moving left is expected to bring me closer towards efficiently navigating towards the goal region without engaging enemies unnecessarily."
