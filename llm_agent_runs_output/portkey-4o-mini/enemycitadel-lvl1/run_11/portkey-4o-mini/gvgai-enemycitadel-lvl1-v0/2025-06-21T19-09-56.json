The avatar is currently able to move to any of the neighboring tiles except the one above, which is blocked by a wall. This means moving down, left, or right is possible.\n2.

The available tiles for movement around the avatar are either empty or contain walls or the goal sprite at a distance. \n\n### Strategy Application:\n- **Current Positioning**: Since the avatar's current options are limited to moving down, left, or right, we should focus on advancing towards the goal by exploring horizontally first (as moving down only leads to more empty spaces).\n- Realizing that moving toward (row=4, col=8) (left) may lead us closer to strategizing the best path.\n- However, it appears the fastest way to continue towards the goal is to move left and take note of the layout moving forward.\n\n### Action:\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action involves moving left to (row=4, col=8).
