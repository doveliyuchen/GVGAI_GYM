The objective is to reach the goal while managing health and avoiding enemies.\n\nFrom the layout, here are some notable points:\n\n- There are crates ('#') near the avatar that can be moved.\n- There are multiple enemies ('$', with one positioned just below the avatar at (row 2, col 14)).\n- Moving left toward the goal is blocked as there are walls ('b') right next to the goal.\n\nSince the avatar's current position doesn't change from the last state, I need to choose an action that allows for effective progress. The immediate option is to attempt to navigate around obstacles to make my way toward the goal. \n\nConsidering the current position of the avatar, moving left will not work due to the wall; therefore, the next best move is to reposition vertically.\n\nThe action I will take now is to move UP to (row 3, col 2):\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving up provides me a better vantage point to plan future actions and maneuver around obstacles while staying away from enemies."
