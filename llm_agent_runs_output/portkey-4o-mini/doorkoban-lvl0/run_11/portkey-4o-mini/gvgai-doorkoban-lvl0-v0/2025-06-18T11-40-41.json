Based on the free spaces available, the best option is to move **up** to (4, 4), as it leads to unblocked paths further along.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nI expect this action to allow for further navigation towards the exit while maximizing opportunities to interact with other puzzle elements on the next moves."
