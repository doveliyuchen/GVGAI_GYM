A move downward to (5, 5) would bring you directly over another hole without encountering walls. Moreover, this aligns with the strategy of checking scores via holes and trying to quickly assemble as many score points as possible.\n\nSince moving to (5, 5) (where 'h' is located) may potentially allow for increased scoring opportunities based on the boxes above and nearby, the best action is:\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action should lead to moving the avatar down to a hole, allowing for score collection and further movement options afterward.
