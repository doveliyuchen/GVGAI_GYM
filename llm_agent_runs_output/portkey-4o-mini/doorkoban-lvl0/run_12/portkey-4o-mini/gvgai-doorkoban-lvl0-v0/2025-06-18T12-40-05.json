Specifically, a box (denoted by '*') is located at (6, 12), which may be pushed toward the hole at (5, 5).\n\nSince the avatar is currently positioned at (5, 4), I can move down to (6, 4) where I will be in line to bounce off the box afterward towards the hole.\n\nThus, the next action to take is to move **down**.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThe expectation is that by taking this action, I will be in a better position to interact with the box next turn."

The box nearby at (4, 10) is crucial since it can be moved to potentially score points if placed in the correct hole. The hole (5, 5) is also important since placing the box correctly would progress the game further towards the exit.\n\n### Strategy:\nGiven that the position has not changed from the previous state, and to proceed towards placing the box or getting closer to a hole, let\u2019s consider moving down to the hole at (5, 5). This allows exploring how to efficiently place boxes in holes while also possibly moving closer to retrieving the box at (4, 10).\n\n### Action Decision:\nI will move down to (5, 5) where the hole is located.\n\n``` Action: 3 ``` \n\nMoving down should help assess whether moving a box into this hole is possible and how to achieve an optimal score.

Since my avatar is currently in the same position and can only rotate, I should perform a directional action to allow movement toward the box in order to retrieve it and interact with the holes or doors effectively.\n\nI will move downwards since that will allow me to interact with the box.

However, moving towards a hole gives more options for box interactions afterward.\n\n### Next Action:\nGiven the strategic priorities, I will move **down** to the hole at (5,5).
