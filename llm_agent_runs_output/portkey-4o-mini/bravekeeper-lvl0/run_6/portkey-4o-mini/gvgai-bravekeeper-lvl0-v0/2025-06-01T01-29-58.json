However, there's a quick monster nearby at (7, 5), (7, 20) which poses an immediate threat if you step out of the safe area.\n\n### Current Strategy\nConsidering the avatar's position and the surrounding layout:\n1. We can see boxes at the following positions where transformations are necessary: (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 20), (2, 23), (12, 3), (12, 6), (12, 20), and (12, 23).\n2.

The avatar at (13, 3) has access to move within a range of empty spaces (denoted by '.') but must avoid moving into any position that leads to an encounter with a monster.\n2.

The ultimate objective is to push the boxes into safe spots or convert them into points while avoiding monsters and managing the time constraint.\n\n### Considering the movement options:\n- Moving **LEFT (2)** to (13, 2) is an option, but it does not provide immediate access to the boxes or safety, and still keeps us exposed to surrounding threats.\n- Moving **RIGHT (3)** to (13, 4) is still part of the empty floor area but does not necessarily offer significant strategic value at this moment.\n- Moving **UP (4)** puts us directly in line with the monster, which is an undesirable move.\n- Moving **DOWN (5)** to (14, 3) is blocked by walls, hence not possible.\n\nGiven the choices, a **LEFT (2)** or **RIGHT (3)** movement keeps the avatar in the vicinity of open spaces while avoiding a dangerous encounter, but it does not directly solve our box-pushing needs.\n\n### Decision:\nI will choose to move LEFT (2) to (13, 2). This keeps my options open for the next move while keeping me in a safe space without encountering any enemies.  \n\n``` Action: 2 ```\n\nThis action is strategically aimed at preserving the avatar's safety and evaluating the surrounding scenario for effective next moves."

However, they are not immediately threatening the current position of the avatar.\n4. **Goals:** The immediate goal is to score points by transforming the accessible box and continue avoiding the monsters and thieves.\n\n### Deciding the Action:\n- The best action is to move left (to (13, 1)), which allows the avatar to push the box and score points.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left to push the box will allow me to transform it into an open box, aligning well with my scoring strategy and keeping safe from immediate threats."
