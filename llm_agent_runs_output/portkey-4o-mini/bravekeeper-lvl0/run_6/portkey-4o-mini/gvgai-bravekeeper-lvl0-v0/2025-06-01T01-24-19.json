Based on the map layout:\n- There are boxes (`@`) located at `(2, 3)`, `(2, 6)`, `(2, 20)`, `(11, 3)`, `(12, 20)`, and `(12, 23)`.\n- The closest box to the avatar is at `(12, 20)`.\n- To the left of the avatar is a wall (`w`), so I can only move right, up, or down.\n\nConsidering the strategy provided, my immediate goal should be collecting boxes (at `(12, 20)` or `(12, 23)`), ensuring I can do this within the given time frame while avoiding thieves. There are no nearby thieves visible from the avatar's position.\n\nGiven that the avatar cannot move left (due to the wall) and the right is the most sensible move toward a box, I will move right.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nI expect this action to successfully navigate the avatar toward the box and bring me one step closer to collecting it, which aligns perfectly with our strategy of focusing on box collection."

However, moving north keeps the door open for future eastward movement toward the boxes since I can then move to (row=11, col=5) as initially I will not hit the box directly.\n\n### Expected Action\nI will move **up** to (row=11, col=5) since it's an empty space, allowing for more options next turn without risking confrontation with the monster.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action is expected to lead us to safer positioning for upcoming turns while allowing for flexible navigation toward the boxes."

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, the avatar is positioned at (13, 5), which is free of immediate threats like monsters, but near a thief (at (13, 3)). The main objectives include collecting boxes, and there are boxes located at several positions, notably (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 20), (11, 3), (12, 20), (12, 23).\n\nSince the avatar's main goal is to collect boxes while avoiding thieves, it is important to navigate effectively towards the nearest box while maintaining a safe distance from threats.\n\nAnalyzing the surrounding space:\n- To collect a nearby box, I should consider moving to the box at (11, 3), which is one step directly left.\n- The box at (11, 3) is only one position to the left from the current position and will also keep me away from the thief.\n\nSince moving left will position the avatar directly next to the box, I will take the action to move left.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left to collect the box aligns with the strategy of prioritizing box collection while staying clear of potential threats, such as the nearby thief."
