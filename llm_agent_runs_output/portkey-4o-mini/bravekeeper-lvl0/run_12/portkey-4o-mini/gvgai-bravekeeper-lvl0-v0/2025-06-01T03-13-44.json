Move **Left** `(12, 7)` - This space is safe.\n2. Move **Right** `(12, 9)` - This is blocked by a wall.\n3. Move **Down** `(13, 8)` - This space is also safe.\n4. Move **Up** `(11, 8)` - This is safe too.\n\n### Suggested Action\nTo maximize progress towards the objective, neither left nor right is productive regarding collecting boxes because of the wall on the right. Given that the avatar can access both `(11, 8)` and `(13, 8)`, moving **Up** or **Down** are viable options. \n\nHowever, moving **Up** might initially lead toward higher grounds possibly bringing us closer to accumulating boxes eventually. The boxed positions are on the same row as the avatar but far away, hence shifting upward seems reasonable for potential strategic navigation later on.\n\nTherefore, I will choose the upward movement:\n\n``` \nAction: 4\n```\n\nThis action allows the avatar to explore more space while keeping the overall strategy in mind, making my expectation aligned with preparing for future box interactions."

The primary threat of the thief directly beneath me poses an immediate risk of elimination if I fail to act strategically.\n\n### Strategy Analysis:\n1. **Immediate Threat**: The thief at (14, 5) restricts movement options and poses a potential elimination risk against my avatar.\n2. **Available Actions**: I need to act in a manner that either moves me away from the thief or interacts with nearby boxes. My current position allows for limited nearby movement (to columns 4 or 6, row 13).\n3. **Safety First**: Given the current danger, my focus should be to move away from the immediate threat of the thief.\n\nBased on this, the best action is to move **left** to (row=13, col=4). \n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action allows me to create some distance away from the threat and maintain a strategic position in anticipation of future moves. My expectation is that I will not remain at risk of being eliminated by the thief."
