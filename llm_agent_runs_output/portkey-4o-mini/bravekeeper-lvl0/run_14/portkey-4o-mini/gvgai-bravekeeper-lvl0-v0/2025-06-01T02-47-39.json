There is a box ('@') located at (10, 1) to the north (up direction) from the avatar's position, which is a favorable target since interacting with boxes contributes to game objectives.\n\n### Analysis of Surroundings:\n- **North (11, 3) \u2192 (10, 3)**: Contains a wall ('w').\n- **West (11, 3) \u2192 (11, 2)**: Contains a floor ('.').\n- **East (11, 3) \u2192 (11, 4)**: Contains a floor ('.').\n- **South (11, 3) \u2192 (12, 3)**: Contains a floor ('.').\n\n### Current Move Possibilities:\nSince the area directly north is blocked by a wall, the most immediate movement options are to the west (11, 2) or east (11, 4). However, moving directly away from the intended box interaction should be reconsidered.\n\nTo prioritize opening the box, it makes sense to either rotate towards the box and then move upward, which is not possible. Therefore, the best available action is to move east to (11, 4) and reassess the next action afterwards.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nMoving east will position the avatar in a better spot, closer to the box interaction while potentially moving towards more open space. After this action, I expect to produce safer options for future moves towards the box."
