Since moving right or down will not immediately result in a rotation, moving down seems to be the most logical initial action to make progress toward the boxes at row 12 or 20 and 23.\n\n### Decision:\nI will proceed with a downward action moving to (row 13, col 5).\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action aims to move towards the area with boxes, aligning with the strategy to maximize score potential while still monitoring my surroundings for thieves."
