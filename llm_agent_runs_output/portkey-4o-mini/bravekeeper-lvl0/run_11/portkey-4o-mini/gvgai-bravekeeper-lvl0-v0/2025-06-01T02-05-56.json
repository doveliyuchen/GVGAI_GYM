Given that the immediate actions should focus on moving towards these boxes while avoiding threats, let's analyze the surroundings:\n\n1. **Avatar Position**: (12, 4)\n2. **Goal**: Move towards boxes, convert them into 'open boxes,' and avoid losing the game by getting too close to monsters or thieves.\n3. **Monsters**: A monster is located at (5, 18) and (7, 15); both are not immediately threatening based on my current position.\n\n### Optimal Next Move\nTo begin interacting with the nearest box, I could either move up, down, left, or right. The quickest strategy is to move in the column of the box (in this case, I can't immediately reach the box vertically). Therefore, I should first consider moving towards the left or upward based on my current position.\n\nI'll make the upward move towards (11, 4):\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving up avoids immediate threats and positions closer to the top area of the map where more boxes may be available. My expectation is to continue upwards to maximize my opportunites to interact with safe spots or boxes while avoiding any confrontation near monsters."
