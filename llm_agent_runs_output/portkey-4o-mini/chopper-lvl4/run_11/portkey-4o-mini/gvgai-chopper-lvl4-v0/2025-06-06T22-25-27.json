Evade any nearby threats, especially the satellites, which might attack the avatar.\n\nSince the avatar needs to gather bullets to continue engaging effectively and also avoid confrontation with the  satellites, moving towards the nearest valuable resource makes sense.\n\n### Recommended Action\nI choose to move the avatar **left** to the position (9, 4) to look for ammunition or avoid potential conflicts, as right and up directions have no immediate resources or threats. \n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving left seems to align with the strategy of resource management while keeping the avatar safe from potential attacks from satellites."
