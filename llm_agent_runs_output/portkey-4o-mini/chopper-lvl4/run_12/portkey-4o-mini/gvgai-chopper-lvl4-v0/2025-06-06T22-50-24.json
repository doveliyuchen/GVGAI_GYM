I expect to either collect the supply next turn or continue to improve my positioning for resource management."

Since engaging the satellite directly is dangerous without ensuring I have enough bullets and resources, I should look to collect resources instead.\n\n### Planned Action:\nI will **move down** to open up more options while ensuring I maintain distance from the satellite.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nThis action will allow me to safely reposition without risking direct engagement with any immediate threats. Expecting this to align with the underlying strategy of managing distance and collecting supplies."
