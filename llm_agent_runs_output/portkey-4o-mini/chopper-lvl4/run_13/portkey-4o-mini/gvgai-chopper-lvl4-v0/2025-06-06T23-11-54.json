Here are the notable considerations for the next move:\n- The tank at (11, 1) is directly below the avatar, with potential nearby threats also aligned vertically.\n- There's a row of satellites that might pose risk, emphasizing the need for tactical movement toward a safer area or to align with an action that engages enemy sprites from a strategic distance.\n\nGiven these insights, I will execute a downward move to seek a better position and remain mobile.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis downward movement will hopefully help the avatar avoid immediate threats while positioning it to potentially attack or dodge future enemy interactions.

You also have access to 'supply' at (7, 25) and (9, 5).\n3. **Kill Conditions**: You must eliminate enemy satellites while retaining your avatar and utilizing resources effectively.\n\n### Current Position Analysis\n- The nearest supply at (7, 25) is two rows up and 7 columns to the left. \n- The supply will help replenish your bullets which you may need for upcoming confrontations.\n\n### Strategic Decision\nYour priority should remain on gathering supplies if you are low on ammunition. Given your current position hasn't changed since the last state analysis, I will take an action that may lead to achieving resource conservation by moving to gather the nearest supply, as this would align with our strategy of ensuring enough resources to engage the enemies.\n\n### Selected Action\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\nMoving left gives me an opportunity to head towards the supply (7, 25) and prepare for engaging with the satellites afterward."
