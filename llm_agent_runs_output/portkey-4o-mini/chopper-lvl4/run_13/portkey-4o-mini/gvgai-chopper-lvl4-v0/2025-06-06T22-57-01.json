The immediate surroundings of the avatar (row 8, columns 9 to 11):\n   - (8, 9) is empty (`.`)\n   - (8, 10) is the avatar (`a`)\n   - (8, 11) is empty (`.`)\n\n2. Directly south at (9, 10), (9, 11), and (9, 12) are empty spaces. There are supply sprites present nearby at (7, 13) (`h`), (7, 14) (`g`), and other supplies are scattered throughout the area.\n\n3. To the south at (11, 0) is the first portal base (`*`) but needs to be approached carefully as there are enemies (tanks and sam sprites) present near the portal.\n\n### Strategy:\n- The immediate goal is to collect resources while also being prepared to approach the portal base and tanks.\n- Since the avatar has a limited movement area due to enemies, moving in a safe manner towards resources while keeping vigil on the tank movements is important. \n\n### Action Proposal:\nGiven the analysis, moving upward to the next row (7, 10) consolidates positional advantage by allowing access to the supplies and gives a tactical height advantage for when we decide to shoot at the portals.\n\n``` Action:5 ```\nThis action aligns with both gathering supplies and maintaining a safe distance from threats while preparing to engage enemies effectively later."
