The adjacent tiles to my current position are:\n- Left (3, 12): 'c' (smokespawn)\n- Right (3, 14): 'c' (smokespawn)\n- Up (2, 13): 'c' (smokespawn)\n- Down (4, 13): 'd' (wall)\n\nGiven that both the left, right, and up positions contain smokespawn, I can safely use one of these smokespawn positions to create a shield against any potential death collision.\n\nI will take the action to collect the smokespawn at (3, 12).\n\n``` Action:1 ``` \n\nThis will create a safe zone and allow me to navigate further without the risk of dying. My expectation is that this aligns with the strategy to use smokespawn effectively."
