Below your position, there is a row occupied by death ground tiles and locked areas that lead to potential death if you interact incorrectly.\n3. The exit sprite (`b`) is located at (11, 1), which is quite distant and will require navigating several obstacles.\n\nTo make progress, you should assess the nearby resources and paths. Since you are currently carrying no keys or shovels while being surrounded by potential hazards, it's crucial to gather resources carefully.\n\nMoving left towards (2, 13) would bring you closer to other sprites and potential shovels located at (3, 13) on a lower row, allowing you to start collecting resources.\n\nThus, moving **LEFT** (to (2, 13)) seems to be a logical action to explore further resources.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action aligns with the strategy of exploration while avoiding immediate hazards, as you currently do not have any collectible items. I expect that this move will allow you to assess the area around (2, 13) and prepare for the next steps towards the exit."
