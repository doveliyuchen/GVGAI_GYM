Moving down could provide additional tactical options moving forward.\n\nSince moving down does not encounter immediate threats and can help unveil further possibilities including the potential to gain the surrounding boxes and possibly navigate towards the exit, I will proceed with the following action:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nThis action brings the avatar down into an area that appears to be clearer of immediate danger and opens up the possibility of exploring more resources or pathways while gaining the protective benefit of the smoke shield."
