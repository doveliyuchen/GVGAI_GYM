It is crucial to clear breakable barrels in order to create a path.\n\n### Move Decision:\nSince I'm analyzing the situation, the most immediate course of action is to shoot arrows to break one of the nearby barrels (targets). Given that both avatars are in the same position, I will use one of them to interact with another drawable barrel.\n\nThus, I will: \n- Use the arrow combination against one of the breakable barrels around me. \n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nThis action is strategic as it helps clear potential obstacles and prepares for further movement towards the goal. I expect to see one of the breakable barrels destroyed, allowing for better movement options in the next turn."
