To reach the goal efficiently, the avatar will need to navigate through these obstacles by either rolling, shooting arrows, or breaking barrels.\n\nBased on the game rules and analyzing the current position of the avatar (still positioned at (row=18, col=8) and (row=18, col=9)), movement options should be explored. The next logical step is to shoot arrows at the breakable barrels to potentially clear obstacles and progress toward the goal.\n\nI will perform the action to shoot an arrow:\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nShooting an arrow will help in determining whether we can break open barriers or interact with barrels to clear a path toward the goal.

The strategy is focused on planning the route, manipulating barrels, and avoiding walls.\n\n### Current Environment Analysis:\n- **Avatar Position**: (18, 9)\n- **Goal Position**: (1, 26)\n- **Important Obstacles**: Walls ('&') are prevalent, making direct paths difficult.\n- **Barrels**: \n  - Breakable barrels '@' are located at various positions, and can be used strategically.\n  - The avatar has arrows '*' at (18, 10) and (18, 11) which can be used to interact with barrels.\n\n### Best Move:\nThe next best action is to use the arrow at position (18, 10). This is to break the breakable barrel nearby, possibly clearing the path or enabling some strategic movement or blocking.\n\nThus, the chosen action will be:\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action leverages the arrow to manipulate the barrels effectively, adhering to our strategy of manipulating the environment to make progress towards the goal.

Use an arrow to break the barrel on the right (at (18, 10)).\n\nFollowing this plan should align with making progress towards my goal.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \n\nFeedback: Shooting an arrow to break the barrel will potentially clear the path for further movement upward towards the goal, as per our strategy to manipulate barrels to our advantage."
