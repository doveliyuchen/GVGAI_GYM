The environment contains a breakable barrel ('b') at (2, 7) and (2, 8) to the left, and tough barrels ('%') are positioned at (18, 35) and (18, 36). The goal ('#') is located at (1, 26).\n\n### Strategy Analysis\n1. The avatar needs to navigate through the level avoiding barrels while breaking others to maximize scoring and reach the goal.\n2. The breakable barrels are essential as shooting these ensures a safe passage and points.\n\n### Action Plan\n- Since the avatars are currently at (18, 11) and (18, 12), there seems to be no chance of immediate danger from rolling barrels.\n- The best approach would be to shoot an arrow at the breakable barrel ('b') located at (2, 7) or (2, 8) if moving vertically up (at the same column) would not be obstructed by an immediate barrel right now.\n  \nConsidering these factors, I will perform the action to shoot an arrow, as it aligns with our goal of clearing barrels to progress towards reaching the goal and maximizing our score.\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action will allow me to target a barrel for destruction, creating a clear path towards both points and the goal."

The area around the avatar includes arrows at (row=18, col=32) and (row=18, col=33), and there is also a tough barrel at (row=18, col=35) and (row=18, col=36). There are multiple barriers and walls which restrict movement in different positions as well.\n\nSince the primary goal is to reach the goal (denoted by '#'), which is located at (row=1, col=26), I need to make sure to move in a strategic manner. According to the current strategy, it is critical to utilize my arrows effectively to clear pathways or to maximize my score.\n\nTo maximize my score and potentially clear paths, I will shoot an arrow towards one of the barrels. Since I have access to arrows, I can shoot the breakable barrels nearby to gain points and possibly alter my surroundings for safe movements.\n\nTherefore, I will choose to perform the action to shoot an arrow:\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\n\nThis action is expected to clear a path, allowing for further navigation towards the goal while also aligning with the strategy to maximize score through interaction with barrels."

The avatar's position is at (18, 11) while adjacent to it, there are two arrows at (18, 33) and (18, 34), and there's a tough barrel at (18, 36).\n\n### Current observations:\n- The avatar's position hasn't changed since last state.\n- The goal is located at (1, 26), and the path is blocked by various barrels.\n- Based on the available actions and the avatar's surroundings, it can either move left, right, up, or down, but must avoid immediate danger from barrels.\n\nTo follow the strategy efficiently:\n1. **Plan Movements**: I need to avoid barrels striking from above. Since the avatar is positioned directly underneath a tough barrel and arrows are available, using arrows to clear a path seems prudent, but I'm currently out of reach of the barrels I can destroy.\n2. **Move or Use Arrows**: Since my position hasn't changed and we can't afford inaction, I should consider moving or shooting arrows if there's a strategic target.\n\nSince the left side is presently clear (I won\u2019t risk being under a rolling barrel), I will attempt to move **down** since there are no clear paths directly above or much pressure from barrels.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nI expect this action to continue my movement towards the goal and mitigate the risk from the barrels above."

The ones at (18, 34) and (18, 35) are arrows; however, (18, 36) is a tough barrel (`%`), which I cannot destroy with arrows.\n  \n### Proposed Action:\nI can move left (to (18, 10)) or use an arrow to clear the tough barrel, but first, I need to analyze if there's potential for movement or better positioning. The safest and most strategic action will be to first **move left**, avoiding immediate danger from the barrel above before making the next decision.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action will help me reposition and verify the situation without getting into direct danger from the potential rolling barrel.

There are multiple barrels, including breakable barrels ('b') and tough barrels ('%') in the vicinity.\n\nSince the avatar's position hasn't changed, it's vital to plan the next action carefully.
