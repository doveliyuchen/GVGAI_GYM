We need to plan a safe route to the goal, avoiding walls and rolling barrels.\n2. It is important to maintain the count of remaining avatars while maximizing points by breaking barrels.\n\n### Immediate Consideration:\nSince the avatar is at (18, 3), the immediate positions to evaluate include:\n- Moving Up (18, 3) to (17, 3) which hits a wall.\n- Moving Left (18, 3) to (18, 2) which is empty.\n- Moving Right (18, 3) to (18, 4) which is empty.\n- Moving Down does not make sense since it leads to a row of walls directly below.\n\nConsidering that the avatar cannot move up into a wall, the next logical step is to explore the left or right movements. Both left and right seem to maintain safety, but as we're looking to establish the most direction towards the goal, moving right could potentially keep us aligned with available future paths leading towards the column of the goal.\n\n### Action:\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis decision to move right from (18, 3) to (18, 4) is based on exploring the route towards the goal while avoiding immediate dangers like walls or rolling barrels."
