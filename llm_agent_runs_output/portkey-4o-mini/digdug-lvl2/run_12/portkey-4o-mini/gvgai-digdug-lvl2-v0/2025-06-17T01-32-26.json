There are several goals to consider, including collecting gems, avoiding monsters, and using the existing environment strategically.\n\n**Summary of the Current Environment:** \n- The avatar is surrounded by walls, gems, and an immediate potential threat (a monster directly nearby at (1, 10) or (1, 12)).\n- Collectibles (gems represented by `#`) are present at various positions which will contribute positively to the score.\n- Movement is somewhat restricted due to the walls surrounding the avatar; therefore, the options are limited.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n1. The immediate next step should be to collect the nearby gem at (5, 7). This will improve the score.\n2. Ensure safe routes to avoid the monsters while collecting gems.\n3. Monitor overall sprite counts and score continuously.\n\nSince the avatar\u2019s last position should change in the next move, I\u2019ll plan to move and collect the gem considering the available actions.\n\n### Decision:\nI will perform the action to **move left** from (9, 8) to (9, 7) to move closer to the area where I can reach the gem located at position (5, 6).\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action will help in progressing towards the gem positions, adhering to the strategy of prioritizing collectible items while minimizing interaction with monsters."
