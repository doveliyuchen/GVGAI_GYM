Since there are goodies (gems `#`) at several positions including 8, 2, and 5, I should plan my next move to stay safe while progressing towards the goodies. \n\n1. **Direction of Movement**: The avatar can choose to move in any direction that's not blocked by walls or hazards. Moving up, left, or down would allow for exploration of more areas and potentially collecting gems.\n\n2. **First Action**: To maximize the opportunity, I should move towards an area that might lead to a gem collection while ensuring my route remains safe. An upward move (to (7, 8)) keeps options open for future turns.\n\n### Choosing an Action\nI will choose to move **up** to (7, 8) as the first action:\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis action keeps my options open for moving either left or right in the next turn and allows for the exploration of the upper sections of the map while collecting potential goodies."
