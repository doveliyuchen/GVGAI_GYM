We can use the shovel (located at (13,10) next to the avatar) strategically to either collect items or incapacitate monsters nearby.\n2. It's crucial to ensure we maximize our score by avoiding confrontation with monsters while also gathering collectibles.\n\nGiven the option to act, since the avatar's position hasn't changed from the previous analysis, I will consider using the shovel to see how it affects the nearby tiles.\n\n```Action: 1```\nUsing the shovel is a critical first step to manipulate the environment, especially to assess how it can interact with adjacent tiles and break ground for future movements or attacks against monsters."
