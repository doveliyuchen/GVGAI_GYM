Since the current position does not change from the last state, I need to analyze available actions.\n\nThe this case, there are two potential moves: left to (7, 8) or down to (8, 9). Moving left to (7, 8) will lead to a free space (.) where no goodies are present. Alternatively, moving down to (8, 9) will also lead to a free space, also yielding no goodies but allowing further navigation.\n\nTo ensure the avatar interacts positively with the environment and positions itself strategically for later moves, choosing to move left would open up potential paths on the next turn.\n\n### Chosen Action:\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\nThis action of moving left will allow the avatar to occupy a new free cell, which keeps progressing towards finding goodies without immediate danger.

From (8, 7), moving left to (8, 6) or right to (8, 8) or even up/down to (7, 7) or (9, 7) is viable, given there are no immediate threats (monsters) adjacent to these tiles.\n3. There's no boulder nearby to manipulate at this moment. Hence the focus is solely on moving to collect gems when adjacent to them.\n\n### Next Action:\nSince moving to (8, 6) would keep you in a safe area and potentially allow you to collect nearby gems in future turns due to its open nature, I advise proceeding left:\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nThis action moves your avatar left into an empty space, keeping options open for the next turn to either continue exploring or go for a gem depending on the immediate safety and layout."

Considering the game rules and layout, my goal is to collect gems and gold while avoiding monsters.\n\n### Observations:\n1. Surrounding gems: There are several gem sprites (denoted by '#') located at:\n   - (row=2, col=5)\n   - (row=2, col=7)\n   - (row=2, col=9)\n   - (row=2, col=11)\n   - (row=2, col=13)\n   - (row=2, col=17)\n   - (row=2, col=19)\n   - (row=3, col=1)\n   - (row=4, col=1)\n   - (row=5, col=1)\n   - (row=7, col=2)\n   - (row=8, col=2)\n   - (row=9, col=2)\n   - (row=10, col=8)\n   - (row=10, col=9)\n   - (row=10, col=17)\n   - (row=10, col=18)\n   - (row=11, col=25)\n\n2. Potential threats: There are multiple monster sprites (denoted by '%') at:\n   - (row=1, col=4)\n   - (row=1, col=13)\n   - (row=1, col=21)\n   - (row=7, col=4)\n   - (row=12, col=4)\n   - (row=13, col=4)\n   - (row=13, col=16)\n   - (row=13, col=19)\n\n3. Collecting strategies: Since I am at (8,7), I can easily access the surrounding areas within one move.\n\n### Action Selection:\nIn my current strategy, I should focus on collecting gems while remaining aware of nearby monsters. To optimize my path:\n- If I move UP (ACTION_UP), I will go from (8,7) to (7,7), where I will be in a safe area surrounded primarily by walls (which helps avoid monsters).\n- If I move LEFT (ACTION_LEFT), I will go to (8,6), which is also a safe move.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFor the best strategic approach while paying attention to my current position and goals, I will take the action to move UP as it keeps me out of immediate danger with the possibility of exploring further upwards. \n\n``` Action:4 ``` \nThis action allows me to maintain safety while potentially leading to a path that can access more goodies nearby in subsequent moves."

Collect nearby goodies (specifically the gold at row 10, col 8 and row 10, col 9). Collecting these will also bring the avatar closer to safety, as those treasures are farther away from the monsters.\n2. With walls on left and close proximity of a monster, it\u2019s clear the safest maneuver is to head right to avoid potential traps or encounters.\n3. Ensure that the avatar can collect goodies before encountering any potential threats.\n\n### Selected Action:\n- Moving to the right (to row 10, col 5) would allow for safer navigation towards the treasures avoiding potential monster threats initially.\n\nTherefore, I will take the following action: \n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action is to move right, allowing the avatar to begin collecting the nearby goods while also surveying the monster arrangements.
