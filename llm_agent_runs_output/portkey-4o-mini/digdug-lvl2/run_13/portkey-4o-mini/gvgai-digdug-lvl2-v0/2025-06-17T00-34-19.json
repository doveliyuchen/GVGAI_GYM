The square at this position is an empty floor (i.e., '.'), permitting movement.\n\nTherefore, the action is: \n``` Action:4 ```\n\nThis movement allows the avatar to explore new areas while keeping an eye out for goodies and monsters, aligning with strategic resource management and territory exploration."

Given that your current position limits movement towards the left or right without encountering monsters, the best course of action involves careful planning.\n\n3. **Strategy Reassessment**: Since your avatar did not move from last state, I should consider alternatives. The most strategic move would be to check if there is an opportunity to use the shovel to deal with the monster or to clear a path towards the gem.\n\n4. **Next Steps**: \n   - The shovel located elsewhere could be crucial to utilizing boulders against the monster if it\u2019s accessible.\n\nSince your position hasn\u2019t changed and there are no immediate actions to take, I will select an action that aligns with the strategy of assessing the game environment efficiently and find the shovel.\n\n``` Action: ACTION_USE ``` \nThis action intends to make use of any tools or items available, particularly focusing on the shovel if applicable to affect the monster's placement, thereby supporting a strategic progression in the gameplay."

The avatar has two gems immediately adjacent to it (to the west and east). Collecting either gem will increase the score.\n2. Using the shovel may not provide immediate benefit since it is not pressing as there are no direct threats from monsters at this moment.\n\n### Proposed Action:\n- Since there are goodies adjacent to the avatar, the strategy could involve moving toward one of those gems. Moving to the west (Row 12, Column 8) will allow the avatar to collect a gem (#).\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nCollecting the gem to the west increases the score while remaining safe from immediate threats.
