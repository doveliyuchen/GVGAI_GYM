Surrounding the avatar are various sprite types, such as boxes ('#'), and ground, with some walls ('&') blocking potential movements.\n\n### Immediate Analysis:\n- The direct surroundings of the avatar at (5, 2):\n  - Left (5, 1): ground (.)\n  - Right (5, 3): ground (.)\n  - Up (4, 2): box (#)\n  - Down (6, 2): box (#)\n\nGiven the current game mechanics and the state of the environment, moving into the left or right would keep the avatar safe, as both are ground tiles. Moving up or down will interact with boxes, which may allow for further strategic movement in future turns.\n\n### Strategy Consideration:\n- Since I am at the same position as before, it's essential to choose an action that will lead to a change in the avatar's position. Considering the options and the strategy outlined:\n- Moving left (to (5, 1)) is less useful, as it only moves to ground.\n- Moving right (to (5, 3)) also keeps the avatar on ground but sets up for future moves with the boxes.\n\nHowever, an immediate and forward-thinking strategy suggests moving down to utilize interaction with the boxes further below.\n\n### Action Decision:\nI will choose to move down from (5, 2) to (6, 2) where a box is present. This allows for potential further moves depending on what unfolds.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action aims to interact with the box below while also exploring the potential score opportunities present in the iteration. If successful, it aligns with the strategy of utilizing the environment for scoring and safe navigation."

However, this position contains a hole, which is a loss condition.\n- The only safe position to move to is directly up (row=0, col=3) or down (row=2, col=3) from our position, since moving right (to (row=1, col=4)) would lead to an empty space (which is safe but does not help toward reaching the goal).\n  \n### Strategy Evaluation\nTo reach the goal while avoiding hazards:\n1. If I were to navigate up (row=0, col=3), I would be moving against the wall, and thus it would be a dead end.\n2. Navigating down (to row=2, col=3), allows me to explore lower rows without immediate hazards (but does not bring me closer to the goal).\n\n### Decision Making\nThe best action seems to be taking **ACTION_DOWN** to (row=2, col=3). This also shows adaptability in strategy, as moving left is not an option due to the hole. \n\nTherefore, I will perform the following action.\n\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\nThis action moves down while allowing exploration of further options to eventually reach the goal, avoiding immediate hazards.

The avatar ('a') is located at (3, 3). \n\nLooking at the map around the avatar, we see:\n- (3, 2) -> '.' (empty space)\n- (3, 4) -> '.' (empty space)\n- (2, 3) -> '.' (empty space)\n- (4, 3) -> '.' (empty space)\n- (3, 1) -> '#' (box)\n- (3, 5) -> '#' (box)\n- Other surrounding tiles have walls or are empty spaces.\n\nGiven that the avatar can interact with walls and boxes, we note that moving away from boxes can be strategic for future interactions. The avatar can only move to a tile that is not a wall '&' or a hazard '%'. \n\nSince the avatar\u2019s position has not changed recently, I'll consider moving in an actionable direction. The most promising move seems to be to the left (position (3, 2)) or up/down where there are empty spaces. \n\nFor efficiency, I will move left first:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left may help to provide more space for future movement or box interactions while exploring the environment."

The goal ('$') is located at (1, 1), but there\u2019s also a hole ('%') at (1, 2) that must be avoided.\n\n### Analysis of Current State\n- The avatar is surrounded mainly by free spaces, with boxes to the right (at (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 10), (4, 11), etc.).\n- The path to the goal involves moving up towards row 1, but a direct upward movement would lead to the hole at (1, 2).\n- Hence direct upward movement is not ideal given the hole.\n\n### Strategic Options\n- Moving **up** to (3, 2) could be a good starting point as it will help us navigate around the hole and position ourselves for future routes.\n- Alternatively, moving right might also provide access to more boxes that can be used strategically later, but upward movement towards (3, 2) appears safer to assess further upward movement.\n\nGiven the lack of immediate threats and a need to position better without the risk of falling into the hole:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action moves the avatar up to (3, 2), positioning it to evaluate the next best move while avoiding immediate hazards."

The closest goal is at row 1, column 1, marked as '$', while avoiding hazards like the hole located at row 1, column 2 (represented as '%') and navigating through walls.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant surroundings:\n- You are surrounded by walls to the north and south, which restricts vertical movement.\n- To the left (row 4, col 1) is an empty space ('.') and a box (row 4, col 5) which can be used to manipulate your path.\n- The goal is positioned above, but reaching it directly is blocked by walls and a hazardous hole.\n\nGiven this layout, your immediate best option is to explore the available space adjacent to your avatar to navigate toward the upper rows, ultimately towards the goal.\n\nCurrently, you can only move right, left, or up without hitting the walls. However, there seems to be a better route by making use of box movements and navigating strategically.\n\nTo begin solving this puzzle, let's move one space **up** to row 3, col 2, as this action not only moves your avatar closer to navigating around the wall area but also gets you that much closer to potential interactions moving forward.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action gets you closer to strategizing a route toward the goal, and I expect to explore more options next turn safely."
