However, both positions lead me deeper into a section of walls or empty space, with no immediate benefit towards the goal.\n\nA strategic move would prioritize getting closer to the goal or rearranging obstacles, especially the boxes which could potentially provide cover later.\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves:\n\n1. **Move Left (to 3, 2)**: This position is close to a wall but doesn't immediately bring strategic advantage toward the goal.\n2. **Move Right (to 3, 4)**: This is still in the same row but leads to space.\n3. **Move Down (to 4, 3)**: There's an empty space here, but doesn't yield immediate advantage towards the goal.\n4. **Move Up (to 2, 3)**: The position is empty, but it also doesn't lead to our goal.\n\n- The left (3, 2) is towards a wall.\n- The right (3, 4) is open but doesn't progress towards our goal directly.\n- Moving down (4, 3) is similarly unproductive.\n- Moving up (2, 3) places me adjacent to another box.\n\n### Chosen Action:\nGiven the options and the need to maintain progression towards the goal while also evaluating potential interaction manipulations, I should prioritize movement that could set up for later interactions or hide from hazards deeper into the layout.\n\nI'll proceed with moving **down to (4, 3)** since it opens adjacent potential spaces and allows for future moves towards obstacles when considering interactions with boulders and boxes.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action places me in a position that may provide tactical flexibility for upcoming moves toward the goal and avoids immediate hazards.

The objective is to reach the goal while avoiding hazards such as the hole.\n\nHere is a suggested plan:\n1. Move LEFT (to (1,2)) to position yourself next to the hole. \n2. However, as moving left will land you directly in the hole which is not permissible, this action needs to be adjusted to avoid losing the avatar.\n3. Instead, from your position at (1,3), you can move LEFT to (1,2), but since it's a hole, you should not take that action.\n\nInstead, you should aim to maneuver around the hole without moving into it. Here, moving UP to (0,3) keeps you away from the hole, but it's still a wall. \n\nLet's execute a different approach. Your current position allows you to safely move DOWN or RIGHT. \n\n1. **Moving RIGHT to (1,4)** does not provide any meaningful advantage as it leads away from the goal.\n2. **Moving DOWN to (2,3)** allows you to explore another pathway while ensuring that you're away from both the hole and the goal.\n\nThus, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action allows you to move down from your current position while preserving the route toward the goal without risking a loss."

The next best route is to manipulate the environment or find another path.\n2. **Use Boxes for Protection**: The box at (1, 5) can be a resource for movement tactics.\n3. **Avoid Hazards**: There are no immediate hazards blocking paths but staying cautious of the hole and laser mechanics on the left side is crucial.\n\nGiven the surrounding layout, your immediate options without backtracking would be:\n- Move LEFT to (1, 2) but that leads to a hole.\n- Move RIGHT to (1, 4), where there is ground (.) and the potential to move forward without risk.\n\n### Next Action\nThe optimal next action would be to move **RIGHT** to (1, 4), which is an open space and allows for further movement toward the right side, where more boxes are located.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nI expect this move will open up new possibilities for the next turn and maintains progress toward the goal."

The goal is directly above, but there's a hazard in that direction (hole).\n2. There's potential for maneuvering to the right to access other blocks or paths which could lead towards the goal.\n\n### Action Decision:\n- Moving **right** (ACTION_RIGHT - 2) to row 3, column 2 seems like a good next step, as this position is clear and might set us up to strategize the next move toward the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nBy moving right, I expect to advance toward navigating the route to the goal, observing if there are further strategic moves that will be available in the subsequent turn."

The avatar cannot move left directly due to the hole. Hence, the next best option is to find a position that allows a strategic move either to avoid the hole or reposition.\n2. Moving up or down into areas with boxes could potentially allow moving left afterward.\n\nGiven the current blockages, the best action is to **move down (from (1, 3) to (2, 3))** where there are more open paths and boxes to manipulate.\n\nExecuting the action now.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving down to (2, 3) should provide more freedom to maneuver and eventually reach the goal while avoiding immediate hazards."

However, there's a hole (row 1, col 2) that lies between our avatar and the goal.\n\nGiven that the avatar can move freely in the empty spaces around it, the immediate next step is to assess the options for moving closer to the goal without entering any hazards, mainly avoiding the hole at (1, 2).\n\n### Potential Actions\n- **Moving Left (to (2, 3))**: Moves to an empty space, but does not advance toward the goal.\n- **Moving Right (to (2, 5))**: Moves to an empty space, still no direct progress toward the goal but keeps options open.\n- **Moving Down (to (3, 4))**: Remains in an empty space and could potentially open paths to other boxes and walls.\n- **Moving Up (to (1, 4))**: Also moves to an empty space, staying on row 1 could help strategize a plan to reach the hole.\n\nNone of the moves directly lead toward the goal because of the obstacle (the hole at (1, 2)), but all the actions maintain control and avoid losing an avatar.\n\n### Strategy Alignment\nTo align with the suggested strategy, I should focus on advancing or positioning myself strategically without engaging with hazards. Since my position hasn't changed in various moves, I will focus on moving in a way that keeps future options open.\n\nFor this move, I will choose to move **UP to (1, 4)**; this allows me to reposition without putting my avatar in danger and keeps my options open for the subsequent turns.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nBy moving up, I'm maintaining the safe control of my avatar and preparing for future moves towards the goal."
