The goal is two rows above the avatar, so moving up seems to be the most logical action to get closer to the goal.\n\n2. **Hazards to Note**: There is a hole directly above (row 2, col 1) and the goal is next to it (row 1, col 1). Moving up will place the avatar in a risky position due to the hole, but it's also necessary to reach the goal.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's analyze the best action.\n\nApproaching the immediate goal requires moving the avatar up, and since there's a hole directly above, this will place the avatar at risk. To mitigate risk, I could consider lateral movements or look for potential boxes or boulders for cover.\n\nHowever, since our main objective is to get to the goal without avoiding holes, I will initially proceed with moving up despite the risk.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\n\nThis action seems critical as it directs me towards the goal. However, I need to observe the interaction with the hole that could potentially remove my avatar from the game if I directly move into it."

Move right to (3, 4)\n\n### Strategy Analysis:\n1. **Upward Movement (to row 2)**: This direction will stabilize the player closer to the goal row but can also bring the player closer to the hazard at (2, 1).\n2. **Lateral Movement (left/right)**: Both options of left (to (3, 2)) could lead towards a box, whereas moving right (to (3, 4)) leads to open space.\n3. **Downward Movement**: Moving down will take the avatar away from the goal and closer to the edge of the map.\n\n### Move Consideration:\nConsidering the strategy, moving upwards puts us directly along the path to the goal while requiring caution regarding the hole hazards. The path to the left offers potential for strategic box manipulation but might not be optimal.\n\nSince the action last taken doesn't involve moving, I should prioritize movement. The move up positions the avatar directly towards the goal line while also considering the risks of being next to holes.\n\nTherefore, I will take the \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439 action:\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis move aligns with the strategy as it aims to position the avatar closer to the goal while assessing the future path towards the goal state."

Thus, moving directly towards the goal isn't immediately possible due to the hole.\n\n**Previous Actions and State:**\nThe previous action must have either not changed the position or led to a rotation. Since the goal is two spaces left of the avatar, I will check the possibility of moving left, but given the hole, this isn't an option either.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Actions:\n1. **ACTION_LEFT (1)**: Would position the avatar in (1, 2), but this square has a hole. Thus, this action is unsafe.\n2. **ACTION_RIGHT (2)**: Moves the avatar to (1, 4), which is open ground without obstacles.\n3. **ACTION_UP (4)**: Moves the avatar to (0, 3) which is still a wall.\n4. **ACTION_DOWN (3)**: Moves the avatar to (2, 3) which is open ground without obstacles.\n\nGiven the layout, the most strategic move is to go **right (to (1, 4))**, as it keeps the avatar safe from hazards while positioning it for more options in the next turn. This action does not lead directly to the goal due to the hole's presence, but it allows for maneuverability.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action positions my avatar onto the ground and opens up more movement options for the following turns, allowing for strategic planning around the hole."

We need to explore lateral options to gain vertical positioning closer to the goal. \n\nThe immediate options available for movement (without hitting the edges of the wall or any holes) are:\n\n- **Left to (4, 0)**: No significant advantage, just moving next to a wall.\n- **Right to (4, 2)**: Opens up new pathways through columns that might lead to boxes to explore.\n- **Down or Up** are not feasible due to wall constraints.\n\nGiven these conditions, I am going to execute the action to move right.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action will allow the avatar to explore further to the right and assess the layout for potential paths towards the goal."

This move keeps options open without immediately compromising my avatar's safety.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\n\nMoving right should allow further analysis of the layout and provide a safer position to make the next directional choice without moving directly into a potentially hazardous area.

Above your position, the row has walls (`&`) and some boxes (`#`) which can potentially be moved to create a pathway.\n3. The goal is directly up (2 rows above) and 1 column left of your position, but the immediate column to the right of the goal is a hazard (hole).\n\n### Strategy\n- Your potential immediate move can be analyzed. If you move up directly from position (4, 2) to (3, 2), and then to (2, 2), this is allowed. But moving to (1, 2) will drop you into the hole. Therefore, we need to ensure we can move towards the goal while avoiding the hole.\n  \n- As for barriers: from your current position (4, 2), you could first move the boulders/boxes to reposition yourself if necessary.\n\n### Decision\nTo reach the goal, let's first navigate upward.
