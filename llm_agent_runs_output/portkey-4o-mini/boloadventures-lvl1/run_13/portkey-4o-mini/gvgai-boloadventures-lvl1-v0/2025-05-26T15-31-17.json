The avatar can interact with it, potentially pushing it back or causing other effects.\n- RIGHT to (2, 4): This space is empty ('.'), allowing free movement.\n- UP to (1, 3): This space is empty ('.'), also allowing free movement.\n- DOWN to (3, 3): This space is empty ('.'), allowing free movement as well.\n\n### Considerations\n1. The objective is to navigate towards the goal at (1, 1), which is two spaces directly above the avatar, but there are more obstacles to consider.\n2. The box at (2, 2) could be used to block paths or create movement pathways.\n3.
