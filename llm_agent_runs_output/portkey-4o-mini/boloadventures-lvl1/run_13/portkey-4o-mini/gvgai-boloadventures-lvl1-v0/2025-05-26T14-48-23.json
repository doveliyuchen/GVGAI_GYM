The avatar has access to push boxes ('#') and must avoid moving into positions where it can be harmed, particularly by running into holes ('%') or walls ('&').\n3.

Movement options are limited due to obstacles. I can move left or down and then adjust my vertical position.\n2. To create a further opportunity for movement, moving left seems most beneficial as it may allow better future positioning.\n\n### Decision:\nI choose to move left to (4, 1), which keeps pathways open for subsequent moves.\n\n``` \nAction:1 \n```\n\nThis action aligns with the strategy of planning moves to avoid getting stuck and creating opportunities for upward movement toward the goal.

Therefore, it makes sense to move left, where I can immediately interact with the box on my next turn to potentially move it.\n\n### Selected Action:\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action is an evaluation strategy to push the box, which could create more opportunities in my following turns and aligns with my overall approach of manipulating objects in the game for pathway creation."

The safest immediate action (considering that moving left is not viable) would be to **push the box ('#') at (1, 5)**. This could help in potentially creating a pathway or blocking off hazards, but the action to go down or right after must also be considered.\n \n2.

Additionally, there is a hole at (row=1, col=2) directly between the avatar and the goal. \n\n### Observations:\n1. The direct path to the goal is blocked by a hole (%.). The avatar cannot move directly to (1, 2) because it will fall into the hole.\n2. The columns to the left of the avatar (1, 2) and (1, 1) are critical for reaching the goal.\n3. The avatar can interact with the box (at (1, 5)) to create new pathway options. However, to move left toward the goal, the hole must be dealt with.\n\n### Strategic Actions:\n- The primary goal is to navigate to the goal at (1,1).\n- To move toward the goal without falling into the hole, the avatar needs to go over or use other sprites that can help in blocking or redirecting.\n\n### Next Move:\nThe avatar can move left to (1, 2), but given it is a hole, that is not viable. It can attempt to move one more step left to (1, 1) directly after solving the blockade. Thus, the best option currently appears to be to **rotate and move** in a way that will allow us to consider the box's placement or the existence of the hole.\n\nTherefore, the safest action would be to move **LEFT** to (1, 2) which will fail but will recalculate and allow for other moves later.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action is necessary to leverage understanding of our surrounding obstacles, but I expect it to fail due to the hole blocking direct access to the goal. I will need to react based on that failure for future moves."

    "content": "To strategize based on the current state of the game, first, we need to identify the position of the avatar and any immediate obstacles or opportunities for interaction.\n\n### Current Position\n- The avatar ('a') is at row 2, column 3 (2,3).\n\n### Surrounding State Analysis\nFrom (2,3), the adjacent tiles are:\n- Up (1,3): a ground (.)\n- Down (3,3): a ground (.)\n- Left (2,2): a box (#)\n- Right (2,4): a ground (.)\n\nThe goal ('$') is located at (1,1), and there are holes ('%') at (1,2) and (2,1).\n\n### Available Moves\n1. **Up (1,3)**: No immediate danger; allows continued upward or sideways movement without risk of falling into a hole.\n2. **Down (3,3)**: Also safe; opens up options for further exploration downward.\n3. **Left (2,2)**: Moves into a box (#), which is useful to manipulate later for blocking or creating paths.\n4. **Right (2,4)**: Safe ground.\n\n### Analysis and Decision\nGiven that both up and down movements lead to safe grounds, moving left to the box is strategic as it allows us to interact with the box immediately. Additionally, moving left could set up future movements to potentially block the hole at (1,2) or open pathways toward the goal at (1,1).\n\n**Taking action to move left seems prudent as it opens up more options for future moves and allows interaction with the box.**\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nMoving left to the box will create opportunities for leveraging it in subsequent moves towards the goal."
