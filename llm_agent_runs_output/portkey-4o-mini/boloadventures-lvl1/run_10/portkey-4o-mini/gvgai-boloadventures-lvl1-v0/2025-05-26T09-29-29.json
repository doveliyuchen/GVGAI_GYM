To reach the goal at (1, 1):\n1. Move UP to (1, 3).\n2. Then, after possible adjustments, navigate to the left to reach (1, 2) and finally (1, 1).\n\nGiven that moving UP is a strategic and valid first step, I will go ahead and execute that action.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action will position the avatar closer to the goal while avoiding immediate hazards; I expect this will set up the next steps towards reaching the goal successfully."

Moving down to (2, 3) is safe but won't directly help move towards the goal.\n3. Moving up to (0, 3) is within bounds but won't help with getting closer to the goal directly.\n4. Moving right to (1, 4) is safe but does not strategically progress toward the goal.\n\nThe rational strategy involves first moving left from (1, 3) to (1, 2), exposing the hole which is not physically reachable as a move, hence confirming that is not a viable option. The most valid and safest choice accordingly is to push toward the remaining viable box.\n\n### Deciding on an Action\nSince the goal is ultimately located in (1, 1), I would consider moving to (1, 2) and recognizing that interaction with the hole results in an immediate game loss. Thus, the next best viable option would be moving down to explore potential approaches, ensuring I avoid dead paths.\n\nI'm thus selecting the action to go right since it represents a stable maneuver ensuring the avatar remains strategically unharmed.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action is not expected to alter our course towards our main goal of reaching (1, 1) directly but gives me options to plan further actions safely without immediate hazards or risks evident in the upcoming turns."

Moving either left or up towards the goal while avoiding the hole.\n\nSince the goal (1, 1) is two spaces left of the current position (1, 3) and the hole (1, 2) is also between them, the safest first action is to move **left** to (1, 2) where the hole is, which would cause the avatar to fall, hence this must be avoided.\n\nInstead, let's move **up** to (0, 3).

However, moving directly towards (1, 1) seems obstructed by the hole at (1, 2). \n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Plan a Move**: Before making a move, we need to check if moving causes the avatar to collide with any obstacles or hazards. \n2. **Consider Rotation**: If the avatar cannot move due to a wall or other obstruction, it will rotate to face the chosen direction. We need to keep that in mind for the next directional action.\n\nFrom the current position (2, 3):\n- The avatar can attempt moving left to (2, 2), which is clear.\n- This allows for maneuvering towards the goal without immediate danger from walls or holes.\n\nThus, the most logical action right now is to **move left** (which will turn the avatar towards the goal area). \n\n### Action to Take:\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\nThis move should get us closer by maneuvering around potential hazards, and my expectation is that it will allow for potential moves towards the goal in the next turn."
