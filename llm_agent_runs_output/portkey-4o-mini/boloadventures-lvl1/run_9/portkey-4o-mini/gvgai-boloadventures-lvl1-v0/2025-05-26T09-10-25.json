The environment is filled with boxes (`#`) that can be strategically used to create pathways or block hazards.\n3. The avatar can move left or right, but must be aware that some directions might lead to immediate hazards or blockages. Given that there are holes and walls surrounding the goal, movement towards the goal must be carefully calculated.\n\n### Analyzing Potential Movements\n- **From (3, 2)**, the avatar can:\n    - Move **LEFT** to (3, 1) - this does not lead towards the goal.\n    - Move **RIGHT** to (3, 3) - this keeps it in a safer area.\n    - Move **UP** to (2, 2) - positioning closer to hazards.\n    - Move **DOWN** to (4, 2) - not closer to the goal.\n\nGiven the avatar's current standing, we should focus on advancing towards the goal whilst ensuring safety.\n\n### Proposed Action\nThe best action is to move **UP** to (2, 2) as it aligns the avatar more directly with strategic positioning to ultimately reach the goal.

Instead, since moving directly to the goal is not possible, and going DOWN seems ineffective too, I should try to WORK TOWARD creating a safe pathway.\n\nGiven with the hole directly in line with the goal, a better preliminary move is actually to go DOWN, perhaps clearing space so later I can navigate back up without risking the hole. \n\n### Next Action\nLet's take the action that moves down. \n\n```Action:3```\n\nMoving down should keep me safe while also evaluating my next moves effectively without immediate risk. My expectation is that I can find a new space to maneuver from there."
