Our immediate goal is to find a feasible path to the goal located at (1, 1) while avoiding hazards like holes and lasers.\n\nHere's a summary of the immediate surroundings:\n\n- **(3, 0)**: Wall (`&`)\n- **(3, 2)**: Empty ground (`.`)\n- **(2, 1)**: Hole (`%`) - immediate danger if traversed\n- **(4, 1)**: Box (`#`)\n\nOur current position at (3, 1) allows the following possible actions:\n\n1. **Left (3, 0)**: Blocked by a wall (`&`).\n2. **Right (3, 2)**: Clear path (empty ground `.`).\n3. **Down (4, 1)**: Contains a box (`#`).\n4. **Up (2, 1)**: Contains a hole (`%`) - not allowed.\n\nSince our avatar's immediate movement options are either to move right into an empty cell or down to push a box, we evaluate the right option first. Moving right provides an open path and allows for further exploration without falling into a hole or confronting hazards.\n\nThus, the best action is to move right to (3, 2).\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action moves to an open space and should keep the progress towards reaching the goal while maintaining safety from hazards."

The immediate goal is to safely reach the goal ('$', located at (1, 1)) while avoiding hazards like holes ('%') and walls ('&').\n\n### Analysis of Current State\n- **Walls** are present in row 0 and column 0, which the avatar cannot pass through.\n- **Holes** are at (1, 2) and (2, 1), both of which present dangers.\n- **Boxes** and **Boulders** are also present, which can be manipulated to create paths.\n\n### Initial Strategy\n- I can move the avatar up or down to avoid immediate danger and potentially create a path to reach the goal.\n- Since moving **up** to (2, 2) or **down** to (4, 2) allows for further maneuvers without danger from holes, I should opt for one of these moves.\n\n### Choice of Action\nTo minimize risk and strategize toward the goal, I will first attempt to move **up** to (2, 2) as it opens up possibilities towards reaching the goal.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action allows for movement toward a safer area and gives options for future moves toward the goal while avoiding immediate hazards."

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, my avatar is located at (row=2, col=2). The goal is situated at (row=1, col=1), and there is a hole directly below the goal at (row=1, col=2). To reach the goal safely, I need to avoid stepping into either the hole or directly engaging with any lasers.\n\n### Observations:\n1. I have walls (impassable barriers) all around me at row=0 and at the sides of the map.\n2. The path from my current position at (row=2, col=2) to the goal at (row=1, col=1) is immediately blocked by a hole at (row=1, col=2).\n3. Directly above me (row=1, col=2) is the hole, making movement into that space a loss for my avatar.\n\n### Strategy:\nGiven the layout and the immediate danger of the hole, I would need to explore alternate paths that allow me to interact with the boxes and find a route without putting myself at risk of the hole. \n\nSince the direct path to the goal is unsafe, I will attempt to move downward, which allows for a reevaluation of my position and access to potential alternative routes.\n\n### Action Decision:\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action is to move my avatar downward to (row=3, col=2). I expect this action will take me to a space where I can better analyze further moves towards reaching the goal while avoiding hazards."
