Moving **Up (to row 2, col 2)** could provide a more strategic advantage as it opens more paths to either reach the goal or reposition without immediately blocking paths with boxes.\n2. **Left action** (row 3, col 1) would only result in pushing a box towards the left which could be risky if a future move is needed up or right.\n3. **Right action** (to row 3, col 3) keeps the movement in the same row but doesn\u2019t progress towards the goal effectively.\n\n### Action Selection:\nGiven that moving up to row 2, col 2 is an empty space and opens potential paths to the goal, I choose:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis moves the avatar to an empty space, allowing for further potential actions on the next turn while getting closer to the goal."

There is a hole ('%') at (1, 2) between your avatar and the goal, indicating that you cannot directly move from (1, 3) to (1, 1) without first addressing the hole.\n4.

Therefore, direct movement to the left towards the goal is not possible because of the hole at (1, 2).\n\n### Possible Actions:\n1. **ACTION_LEFT (2, 3)**: Not possible as it approaches the hole directly.\n2. **ACTION_RIGHT (1, 4)**: Moves you further away from the goal.\n3. **ACTION_DOWN (2, 3)**: Moves away from the goal.

The only object I can interact with is the box directly to the right at (1, 5).\n\n### Selected Action:\nI will attempt to push the box at (1, 5) right onto the position (1, 4), thus freeing up space to carefully maneuver around the hole into a favorable position.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nI expect this to enable me a path around the hole while maintaining strategy and position control for future moves toward the goal."

The avatar needs a path around these hazards to successfully reach the goal. \n\n3. **Immediate Possible Actions**: The avatar can move:\n   - Up to (2, 3)\n   - Down to (4, 3)\n   - Left to (3, 2)\n   - Right to (3, 4)\n\n### Strategy for Next Move:\nThe next best move for the avatar is to go **up** to (2, 3). This is safe since it will not directly lead to a hazard, and it is moving toward the goal.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action aims to move the avatar up to (2, 3), positioning itself closer to the route toward the goal, while also avoiding any immediate hazards. After this move, the strategy will be to assess the next direction further toward the goal."

The immediate area contains walls (represented by '&'), boxes ('#'), holes ('%'), and a goal ('$'). \n\n### Current Avatar Position Analysis:\n- Row 1 (up) has the goal at (1, 1) and a hole at (1, 2), indicating that moving up is critical but requires careful navigation.\n- To the left, a wall is at (2, 3), preventing left movement.\n- Moving right to (2, 5) is possible, where a box is located.\n- Moving down to (3, 4) is also possible, but introduces more boxes on row 3.\n\n### Strategy:\nThe goal is to reach the goal at (1, 1) while avoiding obstacles. Since there is a hole directly above the goal (at (1, 2)), going directly up from my current location could be hazardous. However, the entry point for the goal (1, 1) must be approached from (2, 1) or (1, 1), implying a need to either use a box to maneuver or find the best path through the available routes without falling into the hole.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nI need to ensure my avatar has a path to reach the goal without being harmed, possibly by repositioning first before making upward moves. \n\nThus, I will choose to move **downward** first to evaluate my next positional options, specifically to (3, 4), which provides more information about the layout around the goal area.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action allows for better setup for subsequent movements toward the goal without immediately jeopardizing safety."

Instead, the avatar will need to explore other options (like pushing boxes or further analysis) before making that move.\n\nSince that action isn't viable, I will choose to move down to (row 2, column 3), which is a safe action, to understand better the configurations of surrounding boxes and obstacles.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis move allows me to assess the surrounding hazards and consider further strategic actions towards the goal without losing the avatar to hazards."

However, since the avatar's position hasn't changed since moving left would result in a loss, we should find an alternative.\n\nTo advance the gameplay, it's prudent to move down (to (2, 3)) where the avatar can reassess the situation without the immediate threat of hazards. The goal is to find a valid plan going forward that assesses the positioning of all objects around the avatar carefully.\n\n### Recommended Action:\n``` Action:3 ```\nFeedback: Moving down to (2, 3) provides a clearer view of potential paths to re-evaluate the environment without falling into hazards, while maintaining safety."

The goal (represented by '$') is at (1, 1), and there are holes (represented by '%') at (1, 2) and (2, 1). \n\n### Key Observations:\n- Moving left to (3, 1) would place the avatar on the ground (with '.', which is safe).\n- Moving right to (3, 3) is also safe (with '.').\n- Moving down to (4, 2) is safe (with '.').\n- Moving up to (2, 2) is also safe (with '.').\n- The objective is to navigate towards (1, 1) while avoiding hazards.\n\n### Strategy:\nTo get closer to the goal at (1, 1) without immediate hazards around the avatar, I will take the action to move left (3, 1). This keeps my options open for the subsequent turn to move toward the goal or navigate around any hazards.\n\n### Action Decision:\n``` Action:1 ```\nI believe this move will help me maintain a safe position while allowing potential moves toward the goal in the next turns."

The objective is to navigate towards the goal ('$') located at (1, 1).\n2. Notably, the holes ('%') at (1, 2) and (2, 1) are hazardous and should be avoided.\n3. The path towards the goal must consider obstacles and hazards, aiming for the least risky and most effective route.\n\nFrom the current position:\n- **Left (3, 1)**: This space is empty (.), allowing for movement.\n- **Right (3, 3)**: This space is also empty (.).\n- **Up (2, 2)**: This space is also empty (.).\n- **Down (4, 2)**: This space is empty (.), allowing for movement.\n\nAnalyzing these moves:\n- Moving left or right keeps me at the same row, while moving up or down allows for exploration towards the obstacles and the goal. \n- Moving **up (2, 2)** opens a pathway where I can continue strategizing towards the goal.\n\nThus, I will choose to move up.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action aims to reposition the avatar towards potentially reaching the goal while avoiding obstacles in the process.

    "content": "To determine the next action for the avatar, I first need to identify the avatar's current position and the surrounding game state, notably any potential hazards or the goal.\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n- The avatar ('a') is located at row 2, col 2.\n- The goal ('$') is at row 1, col 1, and there is a hole ('%') at row 1, col 2 directly to the right of the goal.\n- The area surrounding the avatar includes:\n  - Above (row 1, col 2): Hole (hazard)\n  - Below (row 3, col 2): Empty space (safe to move)\n  - Left (row 2, col 1): Empty space (safe to move)\n  - Right (row 2, col 3): Empty space (safe to move)\n\nFrom the avatar's position, my primary objective is to reach the goal while avoiding the hole directly above it.\n\n### Action Decision:\n1. I can move left (to row 2, col 1) or down (to row 3, col 2) since both moves do not lead into danger immediately. However, reaching the goal requires moving upward eventually.\n2. Moving **up** into the position of the hole is dangerous, as I will be destroyed if I attempt to move into that slot.\n3. Moving **down** keeps options open for future movements while also sidestepping immediate hazards.\n\n### Selected Action:\nMoving **down** allows better positioning for future moves toward the goal while avoiding hazards.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThe expectation is to reposition the avatar to row 3, col 2, ensuring no immediate dangers while keeping the goal reachable in the next moves."
