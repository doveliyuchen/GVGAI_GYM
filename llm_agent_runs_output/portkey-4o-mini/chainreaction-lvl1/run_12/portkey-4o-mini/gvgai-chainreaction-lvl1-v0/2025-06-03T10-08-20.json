    "content": "In the current state, the avatar ('a') is positioned at (2, 5). There are various boulders near the avatar: a normal boulder ('%') at (3, 4), another normal boulder at (3, 7), and a master boulder ('$') at (3, 2). The goal is to manipulate the boulders effectively while avoiding penalties.\n\n### Analysis of Current State:\n1. The avatar has no obstacles directly above (2, 5) but there are potential interacting objects to the left (2, 4) and to the right (2, 6).\n2. The goal ('@') at (2, 11) can only be reached indirectly after resolving some boulders.\n3. There are holes ('#') below the avatar's position at (4, 5) to (4, 8), which could be hazardous if boulders roll into them.\n\n### Available Actions and Strategy:\nTo move forward effectively, the first step can be to either move **left to (2, 4)** or **right to (2, 6)**:\n- **Left (2, 4)**: This position is empty and might help to manipulate the boulders.\n- **Right (2, 6)**: This is also an empty tile and potentially might lead to manipulating the boulders towards the right side.\n\nConsidering the proximity of the master boulder ($) at (3, 2) and the normal boulders, let's opt to move the avatar to the right to (2, 6). This allows for the greater potential of influencing boulders in upcoming turns.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving right to (2, 6) could provide better positioning to interact with the normal boulders on my next move and helps in avoiding the holes below."
