Since the avatar's position hasn't changed since the last interaction, I need to decide a meaningful action that would shift our position or have a strategic effect.\n\nThe goal is only one space above your position at (6,11), so moving up seems like the most logical action. By moving up, you will reach the goal immediately.\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis action moves the avatar up towards the goal which we need to reach, aligning perfectly with our strategy to prioritize goals."

The nearby positions present opportunities for movement. \n\nThe surrounding area consists of the following notable sprites:\n- At (7, 10) is a box (`b`), which we can potentially manipulate.\n- At (6, 14) is a goal (`@`), which indicates a desirable target.\n- Also at (6, 15) is another goal (`@`), presenting further opportunities.\n\nFollowing the suggested strategies, a meaningful action would be to move left into the box, as this could lead to a future interaction with other sprites or possibly lead us closer to the goal:\n\n``` Action:1 ``` \n\nThis action should allow the avatar to interact with the box, which can help set up further moves towards the goals, maintaining focus on avoiding hazards and prioritizing collection objectives."
