The available actions and game mechanics encourage strategic movement due to various interactive elements around the avatar. \n\nLooking at the surroundings, the key points are:\n- The cell (row=6, col=9) is empty.\n- The cell (row=6, col=7) has a boulder marked as '%'.\n- The cell (row=6, col=11) has a master boulder '$'.\n- The goal at (row=6, col=14) is within reach but may require navigating around walls and obstacles.\n\nExecuting `ACTION_UP` would not change the avatar's position (as there are walls above), and `ACTION_DOWN` leads to an empty space but does not promote forward progress towards the goal.\n\nHowever, the left action `ACTION_LEFT` will move the avatar towards the boulder at (row=6, col=7). \n\nChoosing to interact with the boulder might open up more strategic options in future turns, such as moving the boulder towards a goal post or reducing the master boulders effectively.\n\nThus, I will proceed with:\n\n``` Action: 1 ```\nThis action moves left towards the boulder, allowing potential future interactions to manipulate the game state in a beneficial way towards achieving the goal."

Moving left (to row=6, col=6): This is an empty spot, which is safe but does not contribute towards reaching the goal.\n2. Moving right (to row=6, col=8): This is also empty, again not advancing towards the goal.\n3. Moving up (to row=5, col=7): This is empty but does not lead towards the goal.\n4. Moving down (to row=7, col=7): This is empty as well and safe, but it does not progress toward the goal.\n\n### Action Choice\nSince all immediate actions do not lead towards the goal, we need a strategy that will eventually direct us there. Given the several paths available, I will choose to move **right**, expanding the area of interaction and examining possible pathways in case future moves provide a clearer route to the goal.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\n\nThis should provide a new perspective on the layout and allow me to analyze for further potential moves towards the goal."
