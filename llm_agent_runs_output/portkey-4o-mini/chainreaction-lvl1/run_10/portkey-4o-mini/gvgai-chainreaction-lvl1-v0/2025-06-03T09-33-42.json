Analyzing the immediate surroundings reveals that there are a few boxes, boulders, and the goal at (row=2, col=11) directly to the right. \n\nBased on the strategy discussed, we want to manipulate the environment to remove the target boulders and reach the goal efficiently while avoiding the holes.\n\nFirst step, since my avatar's position is at (row=2, col=4), moving right to (row=2, col=5) will allow interaction with the floor there. \n\nSince I am not yet moving or interacting negatively, a simple action to move to the right seems appropriate.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action will help me progress towards the goal while also allowing more potential future moves. Let's see what happens next!"

The main objective is to manipulate the boulders (both master boulders '$' and normal boulders '%') and boxes 'b' in order to navigate towards goals '@' and ultimately remove target boulders to win the game.\n\nCurrently, the areas adjacent to the avatar (row=2, col=5) are as follows:\n- Up (row=1, col=5): empty floor (.)\n- Down (row=3, col=5): empty floor (.)\n- Left (row=2, col=4): empty floor (.)\n- Right (row=2, col=6): empty floor (.)\n\nConsidering the available actions and the surrounding state, the avatar can move in any of the four directions (up, down, left, or right). Since the surrounding positions are clear with no immediate obstacles, moving to any of these spaces would not result in any negative interaction.\n\nAs part of the strategy, moving towards the boulders or goal would be wise. The aim could be to head towards spaces where there are further interactions possible, particularly targeting master boulders which are important for the win condition.\n\nTo take one of these actions, I will move **down** to (row=3, col=5), where the next move could interact with multiple objects including the master boulder and potential routes.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis down movement is expected to keep options open for further interactions, staying aligned with the strategy of reaching towards the goal while planning future actions."
