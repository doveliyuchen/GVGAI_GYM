If the player pushes this boulder (via moving down), they are likely working towards achieving the goal of clearing target boulders.\n\n### Action Analysis\n1. **Moving Down (ACTION_DOWN)**: \n   - This would position the avatar onto the normal boulder located in `row=3, col=4`, which can then lead to either moving or transforming it as part of the gameplay.\n2. **Moving Up (ACTION_UP)**, Left (ACTION_LEFT), or Right (ACTION_RIGHT) would not interact with the boulders effectively.\n\nGiven the strategic importance of managing boulders and avoiding static states (where no movement occurs), it makes sense to proceed with the downward action.\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, I will take the action to move down onto the boulder.\n\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\nThis action should effectively move the avatar onto the normal boulder, setting the stage for the next strategic move in clearing obstacles."
