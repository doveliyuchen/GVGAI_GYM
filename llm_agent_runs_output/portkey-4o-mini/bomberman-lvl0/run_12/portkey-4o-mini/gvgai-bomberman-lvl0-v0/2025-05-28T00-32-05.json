Reach the goal door (`#`) at (2, 14).\n2. Accumulate points by defeating enemies (`$` and `%`) and breaking walls.\n\n#### Strategy Assessment:\n- Given that the bomberman has restrictions on movement due to walls and the layout, the immediate options are limited.\n- Since left and right are either blocked or lead nowhere beneficial, moving up will give access to different sections of the grid.\n\n### Action Decision:\nSince we want to explore the available area and look for paths toward the goal or to defeat enemies, moving **up** appears to be the best initial action.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\n\nThis action will help us check for potential enemies above and possibly create new route options.
