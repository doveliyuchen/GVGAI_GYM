Since the avatar's position is crucial and you didn't specify it in the grid, we cannot proceed without knowing where the avatar currently is.\n- If no avatar position was indicated, our strategy must focus on identifying a potential movement based on an imaginary or assumed position near the goal, given that there seem to be multiple paths toward potential goals.\n\n1. I identify that you have various water (`e`) objects and obstacles (walls `*`) ahead, and these impact potential movement paths.\n2. Directional indicators exist, which could be crucial for maneuvering. \n\nGiven the lack of avatar position, I can't suggest a meaningful action right now without further information. Assuming we might want to reposition or rotate in anticipation of moving toward the goal, I will choose to rotate in no particular direction.\n\n``` Action: 0 ``` \n\nThis indicates no action was taken, as I'm waiting for clarification on the avatar's position to make an effective decision."

    "content": "To determine the best next action, let's first examine the current state of the game and our avatar's position, which is crucial for planning our moves.\n\n1. From the map layout, we note where the avatar (denoted as `a` but the actual position is inferred from your statement) currently is and the layout of walls, water, and goals.\n2. The goal sprite `g` is present in two positions: (3, 13) and (14, 9). The objective is to reach one of them without losing the avatar.\n3. Important mechanics to remember:\n   - Water (`e`) is deadly for the player - several segments of the map are flooded or blocked by water.\n   - Movement is constrained by walls (`*`), and various floors provide pathways under certain conditions.\n   - At the moment, actions must not only be about movement but also considering the direction changes of the avatar.\n\nFor strategic action:\n- The avatar's position should change after executing an action. If positioning remains static, a re-evaluation of the action is necessary.\n- Prioritize actions that will advance towards the goal without hitting water or walls.\n\nLet's analyze how to maneuver through this environment efficiently, considering the pressing obstacle of water and walls:\n\nGiven that our avatar's next moves should lead towards goal spaces:\n\nFor the current line of action:\n- The avatar should attempt to **move right (ACTION_RIGHT)**. If positioned at (more specific position required), it might allow for a clearer path towards the goals without encountering water.\n\nI will proceed with the suggested action as follows:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action aims to keep moving towards the goal, optimizing our position and ensuring we avoid hazards like water.

The goal seems to be located at (9,1) while there are various walls and impassable water sprites around.\n\nSince the avatar needs to avoid immediate threats like water and ensure movement towards objectives, maintaining a safe position is critical.\n\nAs the avatar's exact position is essential to determine directional actions, we will assume the avatar is positioned in an area that facilitates movement but also requires caution against water.\n\nBased on this assumption:\n- If the avatar's previous action did not change its position, indicating it may have rotated without advancing forward.
