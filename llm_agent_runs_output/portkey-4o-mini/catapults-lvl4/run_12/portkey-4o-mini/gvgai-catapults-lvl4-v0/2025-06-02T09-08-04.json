    "content": "To effectively analyze the game state, we need to identify the avatar's current position, the locations of walls, water, and goal sprites, as well as any hazards present nearby. \n\nFrom the current state of the map, it appears that the avatar can interact with a variety of terrain and hazards arranged in a grid-like structure. The goal is to avoid hazards (like water represented as 'e'), navigate through available paths, and ultimately remove all goal sprites ('g' or '#') in order to win. \n\n1. **Current Avatar Position:** The avatar is located in row 11, col 3 (marked as '@').\n2. **Surroundings:**\n   - To the left (row 11, col 2): '*', a wall.\n   - To the right (row 11, col 4): 'e', water (hazard).\n   - Below (row 12, col 3): 'e', water (hazard).\n   - Above (row 10, col 3): '@', a possible path (not a wall).\n\nThe avatar's immediate surroundings present a challenge because two directions present hazards (right and down), and left is blocked by a wall. The only viable path for movement is upwards to row 10, col 3.\n\nAccording to the strategies suggested:\n- It's crucial to avoid water.\n- There is an immediate goal sprite located in row 9, col 1 ('#'), which should be a primary objective.\n- Given the layout, moving upwards will allow me to position the avatar closer to the top of the map where further goal sprites can be accessed.\n\n### Next Action\nGiven that there is no other direction available except upwards, I will now move the avatar upwards.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action will move the avatar up, and I expect to see the avatar positioned at (row 10, col 3), which may open further paths toward completing the goal of interacting with goal sprites efficiently."

    "content": "Given the current state of the game, I need to assess the position of the avatar (denoted as 'a') and its surrounding layout:\n\n1. **Current State Assessment**: The avatar is not explicitly mentioned in the layout provided, but from the subsequent descriptions, it seems that movement directions, such as eastfacing aka '@', southfacing aka '&', and northfacing aka '%', are present in the vicinity.\n2. **Identify Goals**: The goal sprites ('#') are located at (9, 1) and (14, 9), which means these are the targets to interact with.\n3. **Avoid Hazards**: Water ('e') surrounds various areas, and there are walls ('*') blocking certain paths. The avatar must avoid areas marked as water to prevent elimination.\n\n### Movement Strategy:\n\n- The avatar may currently be facing east (based on various '@' tiles) with an ability to maneuver towards goals.\n- Noting that there is immediate movement necessary to either get closer to the goals or to avoid potential loss, a direction must be chosen.\n\nSince the previous instruction only allows for new actions when the avatar's position has changed, and assuming the need to rotate before movement, I should either:\n1. Review which wall or water tiles are present near potential moves.\n2. Prioritize moving toward either goal with an efficient path, taking care to avoid hazards.\n\nWith this understanding, I will perform a single action:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis action reflects moving to the right (east), aiming to potentially align closer to the goal while staying aware of surrounding hazards. This adheres to the strategy of prioritizing goals whilst maintaining map awareness."
