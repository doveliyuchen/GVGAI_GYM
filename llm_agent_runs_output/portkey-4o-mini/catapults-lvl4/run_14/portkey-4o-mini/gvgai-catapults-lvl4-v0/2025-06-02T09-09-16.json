This ensures that the avatar can progress without colliding with walls, and it might potentially position for future moves toward clearing the remaining obstacles.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action seems promising, as it avoids walls and progresses the avatar appropriately towards navigable areas. I expect this will help to find a route toward the goal effectively."

Thus, the avatar cannot move down.\n\nThe available actions are:\n1. Left (to (10, 11))\n2. Right (to (10, 13))\n3. Up (to (9, 12)) - however, this is the same as the avatar's current position.\n\nSince the left position (10, 11) is open (.), moving left would generally lead to a safe spot, while moving right (10, 13) leads directly into water (e), which is hazardous. \n\n### Next Action\nConsidering the current options and hazards:\n- Moving Left to (10, 11) is safe and does not place the avatar in any danger.\n\nThus, the action I will take is:\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nMoving left aligns with the strategy to avoid hazards and also aims to navigate towards a path that will ultimately lead to the goal.
