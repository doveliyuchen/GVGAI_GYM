Our avatar needs to navigate toward this goal while circumventing the 'e' (water) and the '*' (walls).\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The avatar likely needs to make strategic moves to avoid walls and water.\n- There are catapults '@' located at various points in the maze that may help redirect the avatar's movement toward the goal.\n  \n### Current Considerations:\n1. Assess potential direction of movement:\n   - If the avatar is relatively close to the target, move in its direction directly.\n   - If walls obstruct direct paths, utilize possible rotations and movements to maneuver around them.\n  \n2. The need to rotate toward the desired direction before moving.\n3.
