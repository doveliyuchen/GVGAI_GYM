However, since there are no enemies in the immediate vicinity, the strategy focused on resource collection and careful navigation can still be optimized.

However, it is currently wise to avoid collecting more than what is needed to exit (maximum of 9 diamonds). \n2. **Engage Enemies**: Butterflies and crabs are around. Engaging with the butterfly can yield diamonds if successful.\n3. **Boulder Movement**: The avatar can try moving boulders to block enemies or create paths.\n4. **Pathfinding**: The exit door ('*') is located at row 2, column 16, which is many rows up, so creating a viable path upward while managing resources is essential.\n\n### Current State:\n- Diamonds are present nearby; avoiding unnecessary collection feels optimal right now.\n- The exit door should be the primary goal after sufficient resource collection and enemy management.\n- Need to be careful about the crabs surrounding since they can harm the avatar.\n\n### Chosen Action:\nAfter assessing the map and nearby items, the best action for the avatar is to move 'UP' to row 8, column 5, which positions the avatar closer to potential diamond collection to recreate a strategy for engaging with enemies while advancing towards the exit.\n\n``` Action: 5 ```\nMoving up seems sensible as it helps position closer to possible diamonds (row 8 has diamonds at columns 8 and 14) while considering the need to engage with enemies effectively after the move."

Moving left into an empty background tile.\n2. Moving right into a boulder (which is blocked).\n3. Moving up into a background tile.\n4. Moving down into a background tile.\n\nSince moving right is not possible due to the boulder, I have the following options: \n- Move left (to (8, 5)).\n- Move up (to (7, 6)).\n- Move down (to (9, 6)).\n\nResetting my current strategy consideration, moving downward (towards (9, 6)) could provide additional exploration opportunities. \n\nThus, my action will be: \n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nI expect this will allow me to delve deeper into the area below and potentially uncover more pathways or interactions."

This boulder cannot be moved without another obstacle, and there's no enemy directly present at this position.\n\n### Objective\nThe immediate strategy focuses on deciding the next action to undertake, keeping in mind:\n- Movement options: LEFT (to (10, 4)), RIGHT (to (10, 10)), UP (to (9, 5)), or DOWN (to (11, 5)).\n- Attack/Interaction: No enemies are nearby, and there\u2019s no action required besides moving or using.\n\n### Movement Choices\n1. Moving **UP** to (9, 5) or **DOWN** to (11, 5) remains viable since either direction would keep options open for future movements.\n2. Moving **LEFT** to (10, 4) gives access to the wider area of dirt.\n3. Moving **RIGHT** to (10, 10) would not be beneficial as it directly interacts with the boulder and does not create new access.\n\nGiven that I have already analyzed the movements and the structure surrounding my avatar, the reasonable action is to move down where there are more paths available to explore.\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving down opens up further exploration opportunities and aligns with the strategy of expanding movement options for future turns."

Currently, there are no visible enemies nearby, and I have not yet collected any diamonds.\n\nSince moving left or right doesn't yield immediate diamond opportunities and moving down onto the boulder is not beneficial either, I'll opt to push against the boulder located at (11, 5) to see if I can clear a path or interact further downstream.\n\nThus, I will take the action to move downward to interact with the boulder.\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis action should help me manage the objects on the board and might lead to uncovering more opportunities for collecting diamonds or accessing new paths.

The aim is to not exceed 9 diamonds when approaching the exit, while also utilizing strategic movement to avoid or manage enemies. As of this moment, the avatar has not moved from its last position.\n\nSince the immediate surroundings of the avatar include various dirt and boulders, I should look for a potential path or interaction that can aid in my strategy while considering the possibility of not moving yet. \n\nIn this instance, moving to the left (to (10, 4)) or upward (into the boulders at (11, 5)) does not seem promising, and moving right appears to lead into open space.

To assess the area for diamonds while managing resources.\n2.
