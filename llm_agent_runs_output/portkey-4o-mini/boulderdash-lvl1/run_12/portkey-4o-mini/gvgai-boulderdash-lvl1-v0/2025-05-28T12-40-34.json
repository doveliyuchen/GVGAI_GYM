According to the strategy, we should be focused on exploring diamonds and avoiding enemies and risks, as well as collecting resources effectively.\n\nGiven that the avatar is surrounded by dirt sprites:\n\n1. There are no enemies in immediate proximity.\n2. Moving into the dirt sprite areas will allow us to possibly find hidden diamonds (although none are visible directly adjacent except for (1,22) which is further away).\n\nI will choose to move to the immediate left (11, 11) to interact with the dirt. \n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nMoving left allows us to potentially explore more of the area and perhaps reveal something valuable while avoiding the immediate dangers of enemies or boulders. This aligns with our strategy to explore thoroughly."

Reviewing the current map state around the avatar, I can see the following:\n\n- Directly to the left (11, 11) is empty.\n- To the right (11, 13) is a butterfly (#), which is potentially dangerous.\n- Above (10, 12) is also empty.\n- Below (12, 12) is a wall (b), a solid obstacle.\n\nGiven the strategy of avoiding unnecessary risk with enemies and focusing on collecting diamonds, my best immediate option is to move left to (11, 11). This area is clear and allows for further exploration without immediate danger.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving left to (11, 11) should allow me to assess further movement opportunities without encountering enemies."

The avatar is currently located at (11, 11), and there are several notable entities in the surrounding area:\n\n- At (11, 10), there is a butterfly (#).\n- At (11, 12), there is a sword (d).\n- At (11, 13) to (11, 25), the areas seem to be a mix of empty space and some more collectibles at (11, 21) and (11, 22) which are diamonds (%).\n\nGiven the game's objectives to collect at least 9 diamonds and reach the exit while defeating or avoiding enemies:\n\n1. Since the region (11, 10) has an enemy (the butterfly), a direct left movement would likely result in an encounter with it.\n2. However, moving to the right to (11, 12) allows access to the sword, which might equip the avatar to deal with enemies more effectively afterwards.\n3. Collecting the sword is a strategic move since it can aid in defeating the butterfly or transforming it while subsequently collecting diamonds.\n\nBased on these observations, I will choose to move right to collect the sword.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \nThis should allow access to the sword and provide me with better options to engage any enemies safely."
