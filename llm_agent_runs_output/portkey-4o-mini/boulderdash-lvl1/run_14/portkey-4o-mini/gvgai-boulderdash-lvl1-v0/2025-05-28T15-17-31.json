The nearby sprites around the avatar are:\n- Above (10, 7): .\n- Below (12, 7): b (boundary/border)\n- Left (11, 6): .\n- Right (11, 8): .\n\nIn addition, I can see that to my right (11, 8) and below at (12, 7), there are boundaries which would prevent movement beyond these points. Overall, the immediate tiles around the avatar are mostly dirt or boundary, which suggests limited options for movement.\n\n### Decision-Making\nGiven the strategic guidance, I need to take a meaningful action because the avatar's position hasn't changed since the last action. Since there\u2019s no immediate threat and no diamonds or resources can be reached directly from my current position, here are the possibilities:\n\n1. **Moving Down (11, 7) to (12, 7):** This will result in hitting a boundary, which is not a valid move.\n2. **Moving Up (11, 7) to (10, 7):** This will take me to a cell with dirt (empty), which does not change the situation significantly.\n3. **Moving Left (11, 7) to (11, 6):** This will also take me to an empty dirt tile, again without significant progress.\n4. **Moving Right (11, 7) to (11, 8):** This will bring me to another dirt tile, which is a passage with no additional resources.\n\nSince I do not have further tactics that can be easily employed in my immediate vicinity, and because the avatar's position hasn't changed, my best course of action is to move up to begin exploring the upper area, hoping to find more advantageous positions or opportunities to collect resources.\n\n### Action to Take\n``` \nAction:4 \n```\nI expect that moving up will give more room to find better opportunities, either by finding additional diamonds or critters to engage with as part of the strategy to manage resources."

The strategy recommends exploring and collecting resources carefully while avoiding enemies.\n\nSince the avatar's position has not been previously changed, I will proceed with an action aimed at exploring further nearby and also managing resources. \n\nLet's move to the left to check if there are more accessible areas or resources to collect. Given the current layout, this seems like a reasonable next step.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action aims to check for further possibilities in the surrounding areas while keeping an eye on the overall resource management strategy."

The priorities would be to continue exploring while avoiding unnecessary confrontations with enemies or obstacles.\n\nAmong the available directions, moving left (to 11, 11) or right (to 11, 13) appears equally safe, but to maximize exploration options, I'll choose to move **right** (11, 13).\n\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\n\nThis action progresses my exploration, and I expect to find more opportunities for collecting diamonds or finding a new path."
