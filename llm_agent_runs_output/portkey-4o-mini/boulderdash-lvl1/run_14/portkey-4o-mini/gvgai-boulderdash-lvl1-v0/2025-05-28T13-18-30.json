The main objective is to collect 9 diamonds and navigate to the exit.\n\nAnalyzing the surroundings:\n- At (9, 6) where the avatar is located, we can see that the immediate area contains only an empty space, with some diamonds available in the map.\n- The next closest diamonds you can reach from (9, 6) would be at (9, 14) and (8, 8) if you navigate around. \n- However, there's also a crab at (2, 3), and we need to be cautious about enemies as you progress towards collecting diamonds.\n\nGiven your current position, the best immediate move is to head towards the diamond at (9, 14) to increase your collection and keep advancing.\n\nI'll take action to move the avatar to the right:\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis should help navigate towards the diamonds and align with the strategy of collecting while being mindful of enemy interactions."
