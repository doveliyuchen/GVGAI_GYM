If I move left (to (10, 12)), it would allow me to explore further but I would not be able to reach any diamonds directly. \n2. If I move right (to (10, 14)), I would encounter a boulder, restricting further movement in that direction.\n3. Moving downwards to (11, 13) opens up exploration paths without immediate hazards.\n4. Upward movement would take the avatar into walls that cannot be traversed.\n\nGiven these analyses, moving down to (11, 13) seems to be a strategically sound choice, opening potential routes towards where diamonds are located later.\n\n``` Action:4 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to help in further exploration towards paths that will potentially lead to collecting diamonds without putting the avatar at risk from hazards or enemies."
