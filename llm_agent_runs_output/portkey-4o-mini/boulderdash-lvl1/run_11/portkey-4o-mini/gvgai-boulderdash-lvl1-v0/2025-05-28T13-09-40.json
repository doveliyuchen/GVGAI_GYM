I need to take effective steps.\n\nSince the last action's result was a stationary position, it implies I need to either rotate or move. The strategy suggests avoiding unnecessary confrontations while collecting diamonds. \n\nLooking around, the exit door is located at (2, 16), and it appears to be reachable given there are multiple paths, though a careful route must be taken to ensure I collect enough diamonds.\n\n### Strategy and Next Move:\n1. **Action Planning**: Since I need to collect enough diamonds and avoid the crab at (1, 6), I should first move towards the diamond regions available since I currently don't face any immediate threats or obstacles.\n\n### Proposed Action:\nGiven the current position, I can move **Down to (12, 7)**, which keeps me safe and prepares me for potential moves towards nearby diamonds.\n\n``` \nAction: 4 \n```\n\nThis move should position me closer to areas where I can collect more diamonds while keeping a safe distance from immediate threats. I expect to gather more diamonds as I explore the bottom rows of the map in subsequent turns."
