Moving up to (6, 8) is an immediate next logical step, as it also allows potential access to chips on subsequent moves. \n\n3. **Expected Outcome from Action**: \n   - I expect that moving **up** will ensure that I remain on track towards the exit and opens up options for collecting chips in the next turn.\n\n### Plan of Action\nI will execute the move to go **up** to position (6, 8).\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action should help me get closer to the exit and potentially position me for additional chip collection."

Since moving left leads to an empty space, it opens the map for future options, while moving up also allows for further exploration. However, since left and up have no immediate hazards, both moves maintain a level of safety and allow the location to be assessed for future moves.\n\nGiven that navigating towards the left opens options without encountering walls or hazards:\n\n```Action: 1```\n\nMoving left is expected to help explore more areas while adhering to the current strategy of careful navigation without immediate risks."
