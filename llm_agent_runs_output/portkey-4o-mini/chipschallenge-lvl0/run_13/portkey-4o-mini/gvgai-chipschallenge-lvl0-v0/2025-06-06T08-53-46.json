There is a red door directly south of the avatar's position at (row 9, col 6), which requires a red key to pass through.\n3.

The surrounding context shows that there are walls (g) nearby, and multiple items like chips ($) and keys (b, r) on the map, giving emphasis on collecting resources. The goal is to find the exit (%) and efficiently navigate to it while collecting necessary items.\n\nFrom my position at (8, 5), the available directions are:\n\n- Up (7, 5): Empty space (.)\n- Down (9, 5): Wall (g)\n- Left (8, 4): Empty space (.)\n- Right (8, 6): Empty space (.)\n\nMoving up or left would lead to empty spaces. I could further explore these areas for possible paths and items since moving down is blocked by a wall.\n\n### Action Decision\nGiven that there are no immediate threats and I can only potentially explore (up or left), I will choose to move **up**. \n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nMoving up allows me to check the nearby resources and possible pathways leading further into the level. This aligns with the strategy of resource management and environmental navigation."
