There's a blue key (b) above the avatar at (12, 6) and (12, 8), both of which can potentially benefit future exploration.\n\n### Strategy:\nSince the avatar hasn't moved since the last action, we need to consider a new approach as per the mechanics. Given the presence of the green door below in (9, 8), it might be strategic to first explore the area to the right or down so we can equip ourselves with keys and items first.\n\n### Action Decision:\nMoving down to (9, 8) seems like a viable option since it may lead us to further exploration options, especially since we haven't fully determined if we have the keys yet, but it also may not lead to progress immediately. \n\nHowever, opting to explore down-and-left to gather resources might yield more advantages early on in the game.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThe avatar will move down to (9, 8), allowing for potential interaction with the green door or further exploration. This aligns with the strategy of collecting resources and exploring thoroughly."

Currently, the avatar has not moved, so we should consider a movement that progresses toward useful items or further exploration.\n\n### Next Step:\nSince the surrounding squares are mostly empty, we can either continue downwards (6, 5) or to the right (7, 6).
