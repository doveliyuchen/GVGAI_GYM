However, there are open spaces and resources on the left side of the avatar.\n\nGiven all this, let's opt for moving **down**, which could widen our options in subsequent moves and potentially put us closer to resource collections in subsequent moves while navigating towards the exit.\n\n``` Action:3 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to be strategic as it opens up more possibilities to access either key resources or better positioning for future movements, ensuring the avatar continues to progress on its objective."
