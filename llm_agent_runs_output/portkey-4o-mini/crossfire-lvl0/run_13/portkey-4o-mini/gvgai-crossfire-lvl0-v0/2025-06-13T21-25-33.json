The immediate threat is the bomb turret directly above me, which could fire bombs downwards. Moving left to `(row=13, col=4)` is a viable option as it avoids the turret's fire, but it also leads into empty space. The only way to progress towards the goal (located at `(row=12, col=29)`) is to maneuver around turrets.\n\nGiven that there are walls directly below (which is not a viable option) and realizing that I cannot direct move upward due to the turret, I will choose to move left.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis left action should ideally allow the avatar to avoid the turret's fire while preparing for the next move, as strategizing safe paths is essential to reach the goal while minimizing risks."

Since the avatar's previous position must be analyzed to determine the necessary movement direction, and we know the turret mechanics may cause them to retreat upon hitting a wall, we may need to start by taking a move that encourages wall navigation.\n\nLet's proceed with the following action:\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action would move the avatar up to (row=12, col=4), which gets closer to the row of the goal while remaining aware of potential threats.
