Therefore, the only available actions are to move left (to (12, 2)) or right (to (12, 4)). \n\nBased on the strategy provided, I should:\n1. Avoid confrontation with chickens, which aren't immediate threats since they are located farther away.\n2. Seek to collect resources. One option is to move towards (12, 4), which is empty and may provide a strategic position towards further exploration or resource collection.\n\n### Available Actions:\n- **Move Left (12, 2)**: This is not a resource collection opportunity.\n- **Move Right (12, 4)**: This gives open space to continue strategizing for future moves and potential resource access.\n\n### Decision and Action:\nGiven the need to explore towards open spaces and potential resources without immediate threats from chickens, I choose to move right (to (12, 4)).\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving right will help in evaluating further actions while remaining safe from any immediate threats due to the current wall barriers. I expect this aligns with the strategy of positioning myself effectively while looking for resources."

These enemies pose a potential threat.\n2. **Wall and Obstacles Layout**: There are walls ('#') that create barriers in the lower part of the map, which I can utilize for positioning.\n3. **Collectible Eggs**: There are several eggs ('*') at (5, 17), (5, 18), (6, 17), (6, 18), (10, 16), (10, 17), (11, 16), and (11, 17) that I can collect to increase my resources.\n\n### Current Strategy:\nGiven that:\n- I need to be cautious of the slow chickens above me.\n- My current position does not allow me to collect resources immediately without moving.\n\nI will take a strategic left move to reposition myself and evaluate further options based on my new surroundings. The left move may provide a better opportunity to collect resources or position myself away from the chickens.\n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nI expect this action to help me better assess my options and potentially move toward resource collection while avoiding immediate threats from the chickens."

Collecting explosive eggs cannot be done immediately since the eggs are located to the right at coordinates (12, 16) and (12, 17), so I will need to move closer.\n\nBy moving specifically closer towards the explosive eggs, I can ensure I am in a position to interact with them in subsequent turns.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\n\nThis action should allow me to gradually approach the explosive eggs while minimizing risks from any unseen threats and following resource collection strategy.
