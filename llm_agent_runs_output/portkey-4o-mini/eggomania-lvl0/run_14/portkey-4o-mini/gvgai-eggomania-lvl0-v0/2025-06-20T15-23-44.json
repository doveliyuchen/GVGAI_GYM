They need to be dealt with since they can accumulate and overwhelm the avatar if left unchecked.\n2. **Resource Collection**: The avatar must also aim to collect explosive eggs for future defensive actions.\n3. **Movement**: Since the avatar has not moved yet, analyzing a new position is crucial. Since the immediate environment has walls, lateral movements (left or right) are limited.\n\n### Proposed Action\nThe avatar is positioned in the lower rows and can access lower eggs while needing to plan to deal with near chickens as they are within an interactive distance. The avatar's best move is to head right to access more space and potential resources, avoiding the overwhelming approach of chickens from below. \n\nThus, the action will be:\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action indicates moving left to potentially change position toward accessing resources (though it may not yield movement, depending on the wall).
