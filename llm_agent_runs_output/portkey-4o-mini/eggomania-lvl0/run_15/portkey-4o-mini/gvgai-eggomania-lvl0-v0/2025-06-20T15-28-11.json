While it is not immediately threatening, it could become a problem later or if I get too close.\n\nSince my avatar position hasn't changed since the last state, I need to consider making a move.\n\n### Next Action Decision:\n- The most prudent action given the goal of avoiding threats and maintaining a strategic position would be to **move to the left** toward an empty space at (12, 13). This helps maintain distance from the chicken, keeps options open for future moves, and also allows potential interactions with other resources on the next turn.\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nMoving left keeps me safe while allowing access to more of the map for future engagements and resource collection."
