Additionally, it is important to observe the state and ensure I do not move directly into an enemy.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven these factors, I will proceed to move **Left** to (9, 0) as my next action since it could allow for better positioning to either collect supplies or move away from dangers presented by the tanks at (11, *) rows.\n\n``` Action:2 ```\nThis action is an attempt to gather resources and reposition without engaging immediate threats, in line with the strategy of focusing on resource collection."

Your primary strategical objective is to manage resources while avoiding unnecessary losses.\n\nTo maximize survival and benefit from your surroundings, you should first assess the nearby resources and avoid proximity to enemies if possible. There is a supply ('h') at (4, 5) and ammunition ('g') at (7, 30) that could be crucial for your strategy.\n\nSince your position hasn't changed from the last state and the enemies are very close below you, moving down would likely put you in immediate danger of being attacked.\n\nInstead, it would be safer to move **right** to increase your distance from the tank and possibly gather resources on higher ground if needed later.\n\nI will proceed with the action:\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis should reposition your avatar to explore safer avenues and find potential resources or navigate away from the immediate threat."

Its immediate surroundings consist of various forms of supply and enemies such as 'y' (portalBase sam tank) and '*' (tanks).\n\nTaking the strategies into account, especially focusing on resource gathering and enemy avoidance, I should evaluate actions that promote survival, such as moving away from threats or collecting important supplies.\n\nMy next action should be moving downwards to collect the 'h' supply below me which might help in resource management. Therefore, I will execute the following action:\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nMoving down should allow me to gather supplies while keeping a safe distance from potentially harmful sprites. This aligns with the strategy of maximizing supplies to ensure I'm well-equipped for future encounters."

Notably, there is a portalBase ('%') at (11, 0) and several tanks ('*') in the vicinity, which poses a potential threat to my survival. \n\nGiven the strategic objectives, I should aim to avoid unnecessary combat with the tanks while moving towards portalBase to complete the win condition. My current goal should involve gathering resources and positioning myself safely from threats.\n\nSince my avatar's position has not changed, I will decide on a moving action. Moving down seems appropriate as it would allow for better positioning against the threats.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action allows me to move down towards more resources and potentially make a move closer to the portalBase next turn, in line with the resource-gathering strategy while minimizing exposure to enemy tanks."

Notably, the map shows a heavy presence of both allies (m - \"sam\") and enemies (k - \"sam tank\" and * - \"tank\") surrounding various obstacles and resource supplies. Since I have not moved since the last state, I will need to make a new action to effectively react to my positioning and surrounding situation.\n\nGiven that I am currently facing potential threats with tanks nearby and there are resources available:\n- I cannot move left (as there's an enemy tank directly at (11, 1) just below).\n- Moving up would keep me in the same column but may not be advantageous given the current enemy presence.\n- Moving down could bring me towards enemies but may also get me closer to available supplies or areas of importance.\n- Moving right could potentially allow me to navigate around enemies.\n\nTaking all of this into consideration, the best move is to navigate down to get away from the immediate threat. This will allow me to assess options further along in the next state and create an opportunity to collect nearby resources.\n\n``` Action: 4 ``` \n\nThis action should allow me to reposition while avoiding any direct conflict with the enemies immediately below. My expectation is to gather any proximal items in the next state and avoid unnecessary risks."
