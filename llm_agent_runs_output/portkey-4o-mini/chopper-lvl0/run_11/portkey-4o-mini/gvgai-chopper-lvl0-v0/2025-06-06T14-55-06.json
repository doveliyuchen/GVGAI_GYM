There are multiple enemy sprites (sam and tanks) nearby, as well as supplies.\n\n1. There are enemies (sam at (8, 5) and (9, 5)) that pose a threat.\n2. There are also several supplies represented by 'f' and '$' that can help in replenishing ammunition.\n3. I need to maintain distance from the enemies and consider the layout of the level.\n\nAccording to our strategy:\n- The first action should likely involve moving away from or avoiding direct conflict with the enemies.\n- After assessing the current location, moving towards a supply seems prudent for ammunition replenishment.\n\nGiven that I am currently at (6, 2) and there are supplies at (7, 13) and (7, 30), a logical step would be to move right (to (6, 3)) or up (but I see no immediate supplies in that direction).\n\nTherefore, I will choose to move to the right.\n\n``` Action: 3 ```\n\nMy expectation is that moving right will avoid the direct confrontation of enemies and ideally position me to evaluate further strategies on the next turn, aligning with the resource management strategy."

I can shift downwards or to the right, but moving down towards supplies provides me potential benefits.\n\nI'll move `ACTION_DOWN` to (7, 3).\n\n``` Action: 4 ```\nThis action will help me position myself to access supplies and possibly use them in subsequent turns while monitoring enemy positions effectively."

My primary objectives should focus on eliminating these threats while managing resources effectively.\n\nConsidering the strategy outlined earlier, particularly the need to prioritize enemy elimination, my next step should be to take action that either allows me to move toward an enemy or interact with a resource.\n\nSince the avatar's position has not changed, I will choose to move in one of the directions where I can potentially engage with an enemy or collect supplies. The closest enemy is at (0, 2), but moving vertically toward row 0 isn't possible from my current position in row 7 (due to the layout). However, I can see that there are supplies at (7, 12) which will also help in maintaining ammo for future firefights.\n\nAccordingly, I will first attempt to move to the left, along my current row, which will position me closer to potential resources.\n\n``` Action: 2 ``` \n\nThis action should help me explore towards supplies while keeping an eye on enemy positions, aligning with strategy to manage resources effectively."
