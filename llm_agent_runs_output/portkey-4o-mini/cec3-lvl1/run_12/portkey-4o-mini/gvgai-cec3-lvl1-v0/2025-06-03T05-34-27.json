However, since the box is located at (5, 13), moving left would not accomplish our goal of collecting the box. Instead, we must consider moving toward the box's location directly.\n\nTo move towards the box logically from the avatar's current position:\n- We can move right to (5, 8), which is still an empty space.\n- The only action contributing towards our goals is to either continue moving right or to attempt to move down, as a more strategic plan would be to move towards the area where we can access the boxes, which is better clarified by assessing the next direct movements.\n\nHowever, assessing from the current state, I will take the next immediate action to move **right** to ensure I can navigate towards areas with boxes.\n\nTherefore, the action is:\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nThis action keeps us mobile and provides us access to other areas. My expectation is that this aligns with the overall strategy of staying mobile and planning box interactions effectively."
