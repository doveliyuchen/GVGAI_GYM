The immediate area of interest is:\n- Box: located at (row=5, col=13)\n  \nThe boxes on the floor can be moved. To progress toward clearing boxes, we should aim to move towards the box at (row=5, col=13).\n\n### Strategy\n- Since I can only move left or right, I'll aim to move right towards the box which may facilitate its collection.\n- Moving right to (row=5, col=10) is the first step.\n\nLet's execute that action:\n\n``` \nAction: 2 \n```\n\nFeedback: Moving right will allow me to progress towards the box, and since I have a clear path, it aligns with the strategy of collecting boxes and avoiding threats. I\u2019ll check the environment again after this move."
