The surrounding area has several obstacles and opportunities for movement. \n\nTo strategize:\n- The next immediate interactions involve moving towards collecting coins or clearing boxes. Moving left or down facilitate clear paths.\n- However, the avatar can also benefit from engaging with the switch (`s`) at (1, 23) to create barriers against threats such as the piranha ('e').\n- The time limit is 1000, providing plenty of opportune movement time, but we need to ensure not to become stagnant.\n\nTaking into account your position, I suggest exploring the left or down direction to collect coins and clear boxes, as both routes seem promising. \n\nHowever, the layout in front suggests that moving left would not directly yield immediate benefits without risk. Thus:\n\n``` Action: 2 ```\nThis direction (RIGHT) allows the avatar to progress towards more open space and potential coins. I expect to either encounter more opportunities or open pathways to manage the boxes and engage with additional objectives."

There are several strategic considerations based on the surroundings:\n\n1. **Tiles near the Avatar:**\n   - To the left (3, 12) is a box ('@').\n   - To the right (3, 14) is an empty space ('.').\n   - Directly above (2, 13) is a wall ('w').\n   - Directly below (4, 13) is an empty space ('.').\n\n2. **Current Goal:**\n   - The immediate goal involves managing the box located at (3, 12) since it can be moved to potentially clear the boxes that need to be eliminated.\n\n3. **Next Steps:**\n   - Moving left to (3, 12) allows the avatar to interact with the box. This is a crucial action since the objective involves clearing boxes.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will execute the action to move left and interact with the box.\n\n``` Action:1 ```\nThis action will allow the avatar to engage with the box, which is essential for progressing towards the goal of clearing all boxes."
