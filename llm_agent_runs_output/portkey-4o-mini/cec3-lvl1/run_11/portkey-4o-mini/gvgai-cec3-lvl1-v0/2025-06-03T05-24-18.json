Hence, I need to take a different action from before.\n- The immediate goal remains clear: eliminate boxes by strategically utilizing the environment.\n\n### Choice of Action:\nThe only feasible and strategic move would be to **activate the switch at (3, 11)**. This will potentially open up new avenues or manipulate the walls in a way that helps in avoiding the piranha or eliminating the boxes.\n\nWith that in mind, I will perform the following action:\n\n``` \nAction:3 \n```\n\nThis action aims to successfully activate the switch, creating potential advantages in manipulating other elements of the environment - consistent with previous strategies."

Importantly, there are no enemies (like the piranha) nearby, which reduces immediate danger.\n\nI need to strategically move the avatar and interact with nearby sprites. Given the position of the avatar and the presence of multiple holes (at (5, 12), (5, 14) and others) and a box (at (5, 13)), a strategic action would be to move right to the box first.\n\nExecuting this action should allow me to interact with the box to eliminate it or manipulate it towards a hole, furthering my goal of eliminating all boxes while avoiding conflict with any potential enemy.\n\nExecuting: ``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action should move the avatar closer to the box, allowing for possible manipulation in subsequent turns while avoiding unnecessary delays. My expectation is that this move will bring me in direct interaction with the box."

Surrounding my position are various interactive tiles, including open spaces ('.'), floor holes ('0'), a box ('@'), and walls ('w'). The goal is to eliminate all boxes on the level while avoiding the piranha enemy (which is currently not visible in my immediate surroundings) and to collect coins when possible.\n\n### Current Game Strategy:\n1. **Check Immediate Surroundings**: \n   - Directly below me (row 6, col 11) is a wall ('w'), to the left (row 5, col 10) is an empty space ('.'), to the right (row 5, col 12) is a floor hole ('0'), and down-left (row 6, col 10) is also a wall ('w'). The box to my right (row 5, col 13) is the only non-wall tile available for manipulation.\n   \n2. **Available Actions**: \n   - Moving left (ACTION_LEFT) would place me on an empty space.\n   - Moving right (ACTION_RIGHT) would allow me to interact with the box ('@') on row 5, col 13.\n   - Moving down or up isn't possible due to walls or other boundaries.\n\n### Action Selection:\nThe most strategic move is to **interact with the box** by moving to the right, where I can then attempt to push it or manipulate my environment which aligns with the goal of eliminating boxes. \n\n``` Action:2 ``` \n\nThis action is expected to be effective as it opens the opportunity to further use or manipulate the box in the next turn for achieving the level objective."
