The avatar must prioritize avoiding the chase enemies, as they can quickly close the distance and pose a significant threat.\n2. The canon should be accessed to generate bullets for attacks.\n3. Moving toward barriers or areas with fewer enemies can improve positioning and safety.\n\n### Current Position:\nThe avatar position has not changed since the last action, indicating I need to analyze the state before taking a new action.\n\n### Next Action:\nGiven the current needs:\n- The player should aim to position themselves closer to the cannon to start shooting.\n- If moving upward to (7, 9) causes further threats, I should evaluate room to maneuver.\n\nI will move down since my current position doesn't represent significant risk compared to other areas.\n\n### Selected Action:\n``` Action: 3 ```\nThis action moves the avatar down to (9, 9) where there are no immediate enemies, allowing for safer navigation and potential cannon utilization on the next turn."

However, since I am now surrounded by potential prey located at various positions on the map, my immediate focus should be on surviving and avoiding confrontation until I can generate more bullets.\n\n### Current Action Choice:\n1. **Interacting with the cannon**: Since there is no direct interaction available at the moment (because I am not adjacent to any projectile-producing cannon), I will reposition to either pick up a bullet (available at (8, 9) and (10, 5)).\n2. **Moving up to collect bullets**: I'll move up to (8, 9), where there is a bullet.\n\nThus, the action I will take is to move UP.\n\n``` Action:4 ```\nThis action positions me closer to a bullet and away from immediate enemy danger while maintaining focus on collecting resources to defend myself effectively."
