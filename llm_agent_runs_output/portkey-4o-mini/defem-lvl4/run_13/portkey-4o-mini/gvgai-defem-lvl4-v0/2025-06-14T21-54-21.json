Moving towards the left or right could provide an opportunity to dodge incoming threats or find a better position.\n\n### Strategy Application\nIn line with the strategy of positioning and controlling enemies, moving to the left might allow me to avoid immediate threats from chase and directional enemies. If I move left to (5, 2), I can reassess the proximity of those enemies after the movement and avoid potential attacks.\n\n``` Action: 1 ``` \nMoving left seems the most reasonable step to dodge threats and assess the situation further.

I need to evaluate nearby threats and choose a course of action.\n\n### Proposed Actions\nI will first attempt to use the cannon to spawn a bullet as it adds to my attacking capability during the current turn. Interacting with the cannon requires confirmation of success to spawn a bullet and prepare for upcoming enemy engagements.\n\n### Planned Action\n```Action: ACTION_NIL```\n\nThe action does not produce a movement but serves as a confirmation for the cannon's interaction, allowing me to spawn bullets and evaluate the subsequent turn's situation based on the outcome while maintaining a defensive stance. After this step, I will observe whether the bullet spawned and adapt my next action accordingly based on enemy positions."
