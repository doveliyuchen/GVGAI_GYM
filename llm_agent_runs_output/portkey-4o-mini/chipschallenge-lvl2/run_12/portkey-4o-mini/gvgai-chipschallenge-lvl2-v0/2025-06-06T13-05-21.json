One of the most critical resources currently available is the flippers, which would assist in crossing water tiles more safely.\n\nTo move towards the flippers located at (row=1, col=10), I will proceed with the sequence of actions as follows:\n\n1. Move up from (row=6, col=4) to (row=5, col=4).\n2. Move up from (row=5, col=4) to (row=4, col=4).\n3. Move upward again from (row=4, col=4) to (row=3, col=4).\n4. Finally, move upwards to (row=2, col=4) and then reach the flippers at (row=1, col=10).\n\nHowever, since the surroundings indicate that I have additional keys and hazards nearby, I need to stay aware of my resources and hazards.\n\n### Action Plan:\nTo start with, I will perform the first action in the sequence.\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nThis action moves the avatar upward towards (row=5, col=4) to gather resources efficiently while avoiding hazards. My expectation is to approach closer to the flippers while keeping the strategy of resource management in mind."
