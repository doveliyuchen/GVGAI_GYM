The next tiles that can be explored are:\n- (8, 3): (`.`) \u2013 an empty space.\n- (8, 5): (`#`) \u2013 a crate that can be moved.\n- (8, 6): (`.`) \u2013 another empty space.\n\n### Strategic Action:\n1. **Plan the Route**: The exit is located at (2, 2), which is quite far. The approach must minimize risks of reaching hazardous regions.\n2. **Resource Management**: I currently don't have any key on my avatar. Therefore, I should prioritize moving to collect resources that might unlock doors.\n3. **Immediate Action**: The avatar has the option to move left to (8, 3), which is safe, or up to (7, 4) if I wanted to explore further upward after pushing the crate at (8, 5). \n\nSince the goal is to maximize the potential for resources and remain safe, I will choose to move to an empty space and evaluate on the next turn.\n\n``` \nAction: 1 \n```\n\nI expect that moving left provides good possibilities for further movement options, as it safely opens up the area above."

However, going down is not an option.\n\n### Evaluating Movement Options\nSince moving down is off the table and moving left doesn't seem to provide immediate benefit, my best options are to either move up toward (8, 5) or right towards (9, 6). Moving either way keeps me safe from hazardous routes.\n\n### Decision\nI will move **UP** to (8, 5).\n\n``` Action:3 ```\nMoving up should position me on a safe tile while allowing me to assess further options in subsequent moves."
